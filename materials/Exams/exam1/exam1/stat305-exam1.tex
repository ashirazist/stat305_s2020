\question

An environmental engineer is testing four methods for reducing the concentration of a certain lake pollutant found in Iowa lakes.
To do this he first randomly selected 20 Iowa lakes from which he took water samples,
then split each of the 20 samples into 4 portions, 
and randomly labeled the four portions 1, 2, 3, and 4. 
Finally, he attempted to reduce the concentration of each 
of the portions labeled 1 using the the first method, 
of each of the portions labeled 2 using the second method, 
of each of the portions labeled 3 using the third method, 
and of each of the portions labeled portion 4 using the fourth method. 
After the methods had been applied, he measured the change in concentration. \\

\question

A certain make of load bearing beam used in construction of large buildings is certified to withstand pressures of 2.5 tonnes per square inch.
30 beams were tested and the pressures at which they failed are collected in the table below.

%-- : R code (Code in Document)
\begin{Schunk}
\begin{Soutput}
  The decimal point is at the |

  1 | 4
  2 | 8

  4 | 2555778899999
  5 | 01122222234559
  6 | 5
\end{Soutput}
\end{Schunk}

Note that \verb!0 | 9! represents 0.9. In this case, the first quartile is $Q(.25) = 4.7$, 
the median is 4.95, and the third quartile is $Q(.75) = 5.2$.

\newpage 

  \part[4] Are there any unusually low or high observations? If so, what pressures caused those beams to fail?

  \vspace{3cm}

  \part[10] The company also measured the heat at which the beams begin to deform (in 10,000 degrees Celsius). The values are collected below:

Create a theoretical Q-Q plot using the following quantiles from the normal distribution as the theoretical quantiles. 
What does this graph tell us about the temperature at which the beams deform?
