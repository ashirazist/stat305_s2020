In the field of psychology, the Dunningâ€“Kruger effect is a cognitive bias in which people of low ability overestimate their ability and students with high ability underestimate their ability.
In order to study this phenomenon, a team of psychologists at Iowa State asked students from the College of Liberal Arts and Sciences to estimate the score they would receive on a standardized grammar test (as a percentage from 0 to 100).
They recorded the student's sex, age, and major. 
The students were then given the standardized grammar test with 50 questions and the number of correct answers was recorded.

      \item If it is qualitative, provide the values it can take (if there are more than three, list at least three).

      \item If it is quantitative, is it continuous or discrete?

   \end{itemize}
