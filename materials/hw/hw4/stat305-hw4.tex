\item
The major cause of axel failure in freight trucks is when shippers exceed the recommended weight limits that can be handled by the axels. 
Issues resulting from these failures have been becoming more frequent as shippers try to cut corners, 
leading members of the state's Department of Transportation to ask one of their civil engineers 
to look into the available data and better advise them on the relationship between excessive weight and axel failure.

A company manufacturing axels provides the engineer with data gathered from conducting experiments loading axels with excessive weight and simulating traveling conditions.
The data consists of two columns, \textbf{excessive weight (in tonnes)} is the amount of weight over the limit that was placed on the axel, and 
\textbf{distance to failure (in tens of thousands of miles)} is the simulated distance to the axel's failure. 

%-- : R code (Code in Document)

\end{center}

Here are some summaries of the data:

$$
\sum_{i=1}^{50} x_i = 64 \hspace{3cm} \sum_{i=1}^{50} x_i^2 = 107 \\
$$

$$
\sum_{i=1}^{50} y_i = 1996 \hspace{3cm} \sum_{i=1}^{50} y_i^2 = 94078 \\
$$

$$
\sum_{i=1}^{50} x_i y_i = 1982
$$

\begin{enumerate}
       \item  Using the summaries above, fit a linear relationship between \textbf{weight exceeding guidelines} (x) and \textbf{travel distance to failure} (y).[10 pts]
   

      \item Write the equation of the fitted linear relationship. [5 pts] 
      \vspace{2cm}
      \item Find and interpret the value of $R^2$ for the fitted linear relationship.[5 pts]
      \vspace{2cm}
      \item Using the fitted line, provide a predicted value of travel distance to failure when the weight exceeding the guidelines is 3.4 tonnes.[5 pts]
      \vspace{2cm}
      % \item Sketch what you believe the plot of residuals vs weight would look like. Why would this be a problem?[5 pts]
