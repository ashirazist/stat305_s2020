\begin{enumerate}[1.]

\item Chapter 3, Section 1, Problem 3 (page 77)

\item Chapter 3, Exercise 9 (page 116)

\item Chapter 3, Exercise 12 (address the report referred to in part (b) to \textit{Manager Gu} for full credit) (page 118)

\item Chapter 3, Exercise 18 (parts a, c, e only) (page 120)

\item An engineer woke up in the middle of the night, struck with the sudden awareness that when reporting the standard deviation for a recent sample of safety criteria tests, she mistakenly used the population formula, replacing $\mu$ with $\bar{x}$, instead of the correct sample formula. 
\begin{enumerate}

\item Was the value for standard deviation she reported too large or too small? Explain.

\item Write the ratio of the formula she used (population standard deviation, with $\mu$ replaced by $\bar{x}$) to the formula she should have used (sample standard deviation). Simplify it as much as possible (note: it should only depend on sample size).

\item What happens to this ratio you if the sample size is very large? What happens as the sample size goes to infinity?

\end{enumerate}

\item Calculate the variance for the following samples (\textit{note: if you are neat with your work, you may notice a pattern}):

\begin{enumerate}
   \item Sample 1: -1.05, -1.0, -0.5, 0.15, 0.6, 0.65, 0.7, 1.25
   \item Sample 2: -2.1, -2.0, -1.0, 0.3, 1.2, 1.3, 1.4, 2.5
   \item Sample 3: -4.2, -4.0, -2.0, 0.6, 2.4, 2.6, 2.8, 5.0
   \item Sample 4: -8.4, -8.0, -4.0, 1.2, 4.8, 5.2, 5.6, 10.0
   \item Sample 5: -16.8, -16.0, -8.0, 2.4, 9.6, 10.4, 11.2, 20.0
\end{enumerate}

\item Chapter 3, Exercise 22 (page 122). Note, parts (b) and (e) are not required but will count for 10 bonus points on this assignment).

\end{enumerate}
