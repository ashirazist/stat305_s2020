\begin{enumerate}

\item \textbf{[Ch. 2 Exercise 1, pg. 64]} Use the random digits table (Table B.1, available at $"https://ashirazist.github.io/stat305_s2020.github.io/schedule.html"$) and choose a simple random sample of $n = 8$ out of $N = 491$ widgets. Describe carefully how you label the widgets. Begin in the upper left corner of the table.[5 pts] 
\item \textbf{
1. [Ch 2. Exercise 2, pg. 64]} Consider a potential student project concerning the making of popcorn. Possible factors affecting the outcome of popcorn making include at least the following: Brand of corn, Temperature of corn at the beginning of cooking, Popping method (e.g. frying vs. hot air popping), Type of Oil used (if frying), Amount of Oil used (if frying), Batch Size, initial Moisture Content of corn, and Person doing the evaluation of a single batch. Using these factors and/or any others that you can think of, answer the following questions about such a project:

      \begin{enumerate}
          \item What is a possible response variable in a popcorn project?[5 pts]
          \item Pick two possible experimental factors in this context and describe a $2 \times 2$ factorial data structure in those variables that might arise in such a study.[10 pts]
          \item Describe how the concept of randomization might be employed.[5 pts]
          \item Describe how the concept of blocking might be employed.[5 pts]
      \end{enumerate}
      
   \item Aisha recently discovered she has the opportunity to upgrade her smart phone. She narrowed her choices down to two phones (we will call them phone A and phone B) but had a hard time making her final decision.
  
She decided to interviewed people she knew who had one of the phones to rate their satisfaction from 0\% to 100\%.
She also asked them if they would prefer to have the other phone.
In order to help put their feelings in perspective, she also made note of how negative she thought they were in general (since critical people might be harsher in their criticism in general),
using three descriptions: the interviewee's personality was classified as overly critical, appropriately critical, or not critical enough. 

\begin{enumerate}
   \item Is this an experiment or an observational study?[5 pts]

   \item What is the population under study?[5 pts]

   \item Identify the response variable(s).[5 pts]

   \item For each of the following variables, 



      - Identify whether it is qualitative or quantitative variable, and 

      - If it is qualitative, what are the possible values it can take? If it is quantitative, is it continuous or discrete?



   \begin{enumerate}

      \item the individual's reported phone satisfaction percentage.[5 pts]


      \item Aisha's appraisal of the interviewee's negativity.[5 pts]


      \item whether or not the interviewee would prefer to have the other phone.[5 pts]


      \item the type of phone the interviewee currently owns.[5 pts]
   \end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}


\item \textbf{JMP Assignment.} 

   Computing is one of the most important parts of modern data analysis. A large part of data science simply wouldn't exist without the tools developed by scientists working at the intersections of computer science, mathematics, and statistics. 
   Because of that, there will inevitably be parts of this course where a statistical computing tools are needed. SAS and R are the two main languages used by statisticians, though Python, Julia, F\#, C++ and others are also common.
   SAS has a software called JMP ("Jump") that makes doing statistical analyses simpler - it is more powerful than Excel or your calculator but requires little in the sense of coding making the learning curve much lower. 
   We will be using it this semester. There are labs in Snedecor Hall with the software pre-installed, but it is free for students and I encourage you to download a copy for yourself using the link below.

   Download: \href{https://www.stat.iastate.edu/statistical-software}{https://www.stat.iastate.edu/statistical-software}

   In this problem, we will work through the tutorial found at \href{http://web.utk.edu/~cwiek/201Tutorials/}{http://web.utk.edu/$\sim$cwiek/201Tutorials/}. Download and install \texttt{JMP} or find a computer with it already installed. Once you have done this, complete the following sections from the the tutorial linked above. For each part, print and include the table or graph produced. (Note: You can save the plots/tables and combine them in a single document).

   \begin{enumerate}
      \item Creating a JMP data table [5 pts]
      \item Bar Chart[5 pts]
      \item Histogram and Box Plot[5 pts]
      \item Stem and Leaf Plot[5 pts]
      \item Side-by-Side Box Plots[5 pts]
      \item Calculating Summary Statistics of Quantitative Data[5 pts]
   \end{enumerate}



\emph{Total: 90 pts}
