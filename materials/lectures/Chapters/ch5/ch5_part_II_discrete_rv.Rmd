## General Info About Discrete RVs
### Reminder: What is a Random Variable?
Random Variables, we have already defined, take real-numbered ( $\mathbb{R}$ ) values based on outcomes of a random experiment. 
- If we know the outcome, we know the value of the random variable (so that isn't the random part). 
- However, before we perform the experiment we do not know the outcome - we can only make statements about what the outcome is likely to be (i.e., we make "probabilistic" statements).
- In the same way, we do not know the value of the random variable before the experiment, but we can make probability statements about what value the RV might take.

### Common Terms and Notation for Discrete RVs
Of course, we can't introduce a *sort of* new concept without introducing a whole lot of new terminology.

We use capital letters to refer to discrete random variables: $X$, $Y$, $Z$, ...

We use lower case letters to refer to values the discrete RVs can take: $x$, $x_1$, $y$, $z$, ...

While we can use $P(X=x)$ to refer to the probability that the discrete random variable takes the value $x$, we usually use what we call the **probability function**:

- For a discrete random variable $X$, the probability function $f(x)$ takes the value $P(X=x)$

- In otherwords, we just write $f(x)$ instead of $P(X=x)$.

### Common Terms and Notation for Discrete RVs

We also have another function related to the probabilities, called the **cumulative probability function**. 

For a discrete random variable $X$ taking values $x_1, x_2, ...$ the CDF or **cumulative probability function** of $X$, $F(x)$, is defined as

$$
F(x) = \sum_{z \le x} f(z)
$$

Which in other words means that for any value $x$, 
$$f(x) = P(X=x)$$
and 
$$F(x) = P(X \le x)$$

### Common Terms and Notation for Discrete RVs (cont)

The values that $X$ can take and the probabilities attached to those values are called the **probability distribution** of $X$ (since we are talking about how the total probability 1 gets spread out on (or distributed to) the values that $X$ can take).

**Example**

Suppose that the we roll a die and let $T$ be the number of dots facing up. Define the probability distribution of $T$. Find $f(3)$ and $F(6)$.

>The *cumulative probability distribution (cdf)* for a random variable $X$ is a function $F(x)$ that for each number $x$ gives the probability that $X$ takes that value or a smaller one, $F(x) = P[X \leq x]$.

Since (for discrete distributions) probabilities are calculated by summing values of $f(x)$,

$$
F(x) = P[X \le x] = \sum\limits_{y \le x} f(y)
$$

### Mean of a Discrete Random Variable

For a discrete random varable, $X$, which can take values $x_1, x_2, ...$ we define **the mean of X** (also known as **the expected value of X**) as:

$$
E(X) = \sum_{i=1}^n x_i \cdot f(x_i)

We often use the symbol $\mu$ instead of $E(X)$.

Also, just to be confusing, you will often see $EX$ instead of $E(X)$. Use context clues.

There are other usefule ways to write this, most importantly:

$$
Var(X) = \sum_{i=1}^n x_i^2 \cdot f(x_i) -  \mu^2

which is the same as

$$

**Discrete Random Variables**

- Discrete RVs are RVs that will take one of a countable set of values.

- When working with a discrete random variable, it is common to need or use the RV's 

  - probability distribution: the values the RV can take and their probabilities

  - probability function: a function where $f(x) = P(X=x)$

  - cumulative probability function: a function where $F(x) = P(X \le x)$.

  - mean: a value for $X$ defined by $EX = \sum_{x} x \cdot f(x)$

  - variance: a value for $X$ defined by $VarX = \sum_{x} (x - \mu)^2 \cdot f(x)$

### Why Are Some Distributions Worth Naming?

Even though you may create a random variable in a unique scenario, the way that it's probability distribution behaves (mathematically) may have a lot in common with other random variables in other scenarios. For instance,

> I roll a die until I see a 6 appear and then stop. I call $X$ the number of times I have to roll the die in total. 

> I flip a coin until I see heads appear and then stop. I call $Y$ the number of times I have to flip the coin in total.

> I apply for home loans until I get accepted and then I stop. I call $Z$ the number of times I have to apply for a loan in total.

### Why Are Some Distributions Worth Naming? (cont)

In each ot the above cases, we count the number of times we have to do some action until we see some specific result. The only thing that really changes from the random variables perspective is the likelyhood that we see the specific result each time we try.

Mathematically, that's not a lot of difference. And if we can really understand the probability behavior of one of these scenarios then we can move our understanding to the different scenario pretty easily.

By recognizing the commonality between these scenarios, we have been able to identify many random variables that behave very similarly.
We describe the similarity in the way the random variables behave by saying that they have a common/shared distribution.

We study the most useful ones by themselves.

- In order to say that " $X$ has a bernoulli distribution with success probability $p$ " we write $X \sim Bernoulli(p)$

- Trials which results in which the only possible outcomes are "success" or "failure" are called **Bernoulli Trials**

- The value $p$ is the Bernoulli distribution's **parameter**. We don't treat parameters like random values - they are fixed, related to the real process we are studying.

- "Success" does not mean something we would perceive as "good" has happened. It just means the outcome we were watching for was the outcome we got.

- Please note: we have two outcomes, but the probability for each outcome is **not** the same (duh!).

A few useful notes:

- In order to say that " $X$ has a binomial distribution with $n$ trials and success probability $p$" we write $X \sim Binomial(n, p)$

- If $X_1, X_2, \ldots, X_n$ are $n$ independent Bernoulli random variables with the same $p$ then $X = X_1 + X_2 + \ldots + X_n$ is a binomial random variable with $n$ trials and success probability $p$.

- Again, $n$ and $p$ are referred to as "parameters" for the Binomial distribution. Both are considered fixed.

- Don't focus on the actual way we got the expected value - focus on the trick of trying to get part of your complicated summation to "go away" by turning it into the sum of a probability function.

### The Geometric Distribution

**Cumulative probability function**: $F(x) = 1 - (1 - p)^x$

Here's how we get that cumulative probability function:

- The probability of a failed trial is $1-p$. 
- The probability the first trial fails is also just $1-p$.
- The probability that the first two trials both fail is $(1 - p) \cdot (1 - p) = (1 - p)^2$.
- The probability that the first $x$ trials all fail is $(1 - p)^x$.
- This gets us to this math:
\begin{align}
F(x) &= P(X \le x) \\\\
     &= 1 - P(X > x) \\\\
     &= 1 - (1-p)^x
\end{align}

**NiCad batteries**: An experimental program was successful in reducing the percentage of manufactured NiCad cells with internal shorts to around $1\%$. Let $T$ be the test number at which the first short is discovered. Then, $T \sim \text{Geom}(p)$.

Calculate

A shipment of 200 widgets arrives from a new widget distributor. The distributor has claimed that the widgets there is only a 10% defective rate on the widgets. Let $X$ be the random variable asociated with the number of trials untill finding the first defective widgets.

- What is the probability distribution associated with this random variable $X$? Precisely specify the parameter(s).

### The Poisson Distribution

**Origin**: A rare occurance is watched for over a specified interval of time or space.

It's often important to keep track of the total number of occurrences of some relatively rare phenomenon.

**Definition**

Consider a variable
>X : the count of occurences of a phenomenon across a specified interval of time or space 


or 
>X: the number of times the rare occurance is observed

**probability function**:

The **Poisson**$(\lambda)$ distribution is a discrete probability distribution with pmf


$$f(x) = \begin{cases}
\dfrac{e^{-\lambda} \lambda^x}{x!} & x = 0, 1, ... \\\\
0 & o.w.
\end{cases}$$

### The Poisson Distribution
These occurrences must:
- be independent
- be sequential in time ( no two occurances at once)
- occur at the same constant rate $\lambda$

$\lambda$ the *rate parameter*, is the expected number of occurances in **the specified interval of time or space** (i.e $\text{E(X)}= \lambda$)

> $N$ is the number of $\alpha$-particles emitted from a small bar of polonium, registered by a counter in a minute, $\lambda= 459.21$ particles per **minute**

> $J$ is the number of particles per hour, $\lambda= 459.21 * 60= 27,552.6$ particles per **hour**.
