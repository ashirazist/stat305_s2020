## Joint Distributions

We often need to consider two random variables together - for instance, we may consider
- the length and weight of a squirrel,
- the loudness and clarity of a speaker,
- the blood concentration of Protein A, B, and C
and so on.

This means that we need a way to describe the probability of two variables _jointly_. We call the way the probability is simultaneously assigned the "joint distribution".

### Joint distribution of discrete random variables

For several discrete random variable, the device typically used to specify probabilities is a *joint probability function*. The two-variable version of this is defined.


>A **joint probability function (joint pmf)** for discrete random variables $X$ and $Y$ is a nonnegative function $f(x, y)$, giving the probability that (simultaneously) $X$ takes the values $x$ and $Y$ takes the values $y$. That is,
$$
f(x, y) = P[X = x \text{ and } Y = y]
$$


Properties of a valid joint pmf:

- $f(x, y) \in [0, 1]$ for all $x, y$

- $\sum_{x, y} f(x.y)= 1$

### Joint distribution of discrete random variables

So we have probability functions for $X$, probability functions for $Y$ and now a probability function for $X$ and $Y$ together - that's a lot of $f$s floating around though! In order to be clear which function we refer to when we refer to $"f"$, we also add some subscripts

Suppose $X$ and $Y$ are two discrete random variables.

- we may need to identify the _joint probability function_ using $f_{XY}(x, y)$, 

- we may need to identify the probability function of $X$ by itself (aka the _marginal probability function_ for $X$) using $f_{X}(x)$,

- we may need to identify the probability function of $Y$ by itself (aka the _marginal probability function_ for $Y$) using $f_{Y}(y)$

### Marginal distributions

In a bivariate problem, one can add down columns in the (two-way) table of $f(x, y)$ to get values for the probability function of $X$, $f_X(x)$ and across rows in the same table to get values for the probability distribution of $Y$, $f_Y(y)$.


The individual probability functions for discrete random variables $X$ and $Y$ with joint probability function $f(x, y)$ are called **marginal probability functions**. They are obtained by summing $f(x, y)$ values over all possible values of the other variable.

Discrete random variables $X$ and $Y$ are **independent** if their joint distribution function $f(x, y)$ is the product of their respective marginal probability functions. This is, 
>independence means that
$$
f(x, y) = f_X(x)f_Y(y) \qquad \text{for all } x, y.

If this does not hold, then $X$ and $Y$ are **dependent**




If $X$ and $Y$ are not only independent but also have the same marginal distribution, then they are **independent and identically distributed (iid)**.

###Functions of Random Variables
A random variable can be thought of as a function whose input is an outcome and whose output is a real number. When we take a function of the value the random variable takes, the resulting value  still depends on the outcome of a random experiment - in other words: functions of random variables are random variables.

This means that a function of a random variable will have probabilities attached to the value it takes, based on the value taken by the random variable. It also means functions of random variables will have: 

>- probability functions (if discrete) or probability density functions (if continuous) 
>- cumulative probability functions (if discrete) or cumulative density functions (if continuous)

For engineering purposes, it often suffices to know the mean and variance for a function of several random variables, $U = g(X_1, X_2, \dots, X_n)$ (as opposed to knowing the whole distribution of $U$). When $g$ is **linear**, there are explicit functions.

**Proposition:** If $X_1, X_2, \dots, X_n$ are $n$ **independent** random variables and $a_0, a_1, \dots, a_n$ are $n + 1$ constants, then consider  
$$U = a_0 + a_1X_1 + a_2X_2 + \cdots + a_nX_n$$

One of the most frequently used statistics in engineering applications is the sample mean. We can relate the mean and variance of the probability distribution of the sample mean to those of a single observation when an iid model is appropriate.

In the case of the sample mean, if the sample size $(n)$ is large enough, we can also approximate the *shape* of the *probability distribution function* of the sample mean!

If $X_1, \dots, X_n$ are **independent** and **identically** distributed (iid) random variable (with mean $\mu$ and variance $\sigma^2$), then for large $n$, the variable $\overline{X}$ is approximately normally distributed. That is,

$$
\overline{X} \stackrel{\cdot}{\sim} Normal\left(\mu, \frac{\sigma^2}{n}\right)
