## Joint Distributions

We often need to consider two random variables together - for instance, we may consider
- the length and weight of a squirrel,
- the loudness and clarity of a speaker,
- the blood concentration of Protein A, B, and C
and so on.

This means that we need a way to describe the probability of two variables _jointly_. We call the way the probability is simultaneously assigned the "joint distribution".

### Joint distribution of discrete random variables

For several discrete random variable, the device typically used to specify probabilities is a *joint probability function*. The two-variable version of this is defined.


&gt;A **joint probability function (joint pmf)** for discrete random variables `\(X\)` and `\(Y\)` is a nonnegative function `\(f(x, y)\)`, giving the probability that (simultaneously) `\(X\)` takes the values `\(x\)` and `\(Y\)` takes the values `\(y\)`. That is,
$$
f(x, y) = P[X = x \text{ and } Y = y]
$$


Properties of a valid joint pmf:

- `\(f(x, y) \in [0, 1]\)` for all `\(x, y\)`

- `\(\sum_{x, y} f(x.y)= 1\)`

### Joint distribution of discrete random variables

So we have probability functions for `\(X\)`, probability functions for `\(Y\)` and now a probability function for `\(X\)` and `\(Y\)` together - that's a lot of `\(f\)`s floating around though! In order to be clear which function we refer to when we refer to `\("f"\)`, we also add some subscripts

Suppose `\(X\)` and `\(Y\)` are two discrete random variables.

- we may need to identify the _joint probability function_ using `\(f_{XY}(x, y)\)`, 

- we may need to identify the probability function of `\(X\)` by itself (aka the _marginal probability function_ for `\(X\)`) using `\(f_{X}(x)\)`,

- we may need to identify the probability function of `\(Y\)` by itself (aka the _marginal probability function_ for `\(Y\)`) using `\(f_{Y}(y)\)`

### Marginal distributions

In a bivariate problem, one can add down columns in the (two-way) table of `\(f(x, y)\)` to get values for the probability function of `\(X\)`, `\(f_X(x)\)` and across rows in the same table to get values for the probability distribution of `\(Y\)`, `\(f_Y(y)\)`.


The individual probability functions for discrete random variables `\(X\)` and `\(Y\)` with joint probability function `\(f(x, y)\)` are called **marginal probability functions**. They are obtained by summing `\(f(x, y)\)` values over all possible values of the other variable.

&gt;Let `\(X\)` and `\(Y\)` be discrete random variables with joint probability function 
&gt;Then the marginal probability function for `\(X\)` can be found by:
&gt;$$f\_{X}(x) = \sum\_{y} f\_{XY}(x, y) $$
&gt;
&gt;and the marginal probability function for `\(Y\)` can be found by:
&gt;$$f\_{Y}(y) = \sum\_{x} f\_{XY}(x, y)

###Conditional Distribution of Discrete Random Variables

When working with several random variables, it is often useful to think about what is expected of one of the variables, given the values assumed by all others.


&gt;For discrete random variables `\(X\)` and `\(Y\)` with joint probability function `\(f(x, y)\)`, the **conditional probability function of `\(X\)` given `\(Y = y\)`** is *a function of `\(x\)`*
`$$f_{X|Y}(x|y) = \frac{f(x, y)}{f_{Y}(y)} = \frac{f(x, y)}{\sum\limits_{x}f(x, y)}$$`
and the **conditional probability function of `\(Y\)` given `\(X = x\)`** is *a function of `\(y\)`*
`$$f_{Y|X}(y|x) = \frac{f(x, y)}{f_{X}(x)} = \frac{f(x, y)}{\sum\limits_{y}f(x, y)}.$$`

Discrete random variables `\(X\)` and `\(Y\)` are **independent** if their joint distribution function `\(f(x, y)\)` is the product of their respective marginal probability functions. This is, 
&gt;independence means that
$$
f(x, y) = f_X(x)f_Y(y) \qquad \text{for all } x, y.
$$
If this does not hold, then `\(X\)` and `\(Y\)` are **dependent**




If `\(X\)` and `\(Y\)` are not only independent but also have the same marginal distribution, then they are **independent and identically distributed (iid)**.

###Functions of Random Variables
A random variable can be thought of as a function whose input is an outcome and whose output is a real number. When we take a function of the value the random variable takes, the resulting value  still depends on the outcome of a random experiment - in other words: functions of random variables are random variables.

This means that a function of a random variable will have probabilities attached to the value it takes, based on the value taken by the random variable. It also means functions of random variables will have: 

&gt;- probability functions (if discrete) or probability density functions (if continuous) 
&gt;- cumulative probability functions (if discrete) or cumulative density functions (if continuous)
&gt;- expected values and variances

### Linear combinations

For engineering purposes, it often suffices to know the mean and variance for a function of several random variables, `\(U = g(X_1, X_2, \dots, X_n)\)` (as opposed to knowing the whole distribution of `\(U\)`). When `\(g\)` is **linear**, there are explicit functions.

**Proposition:** If `\(X_1, X_2, \dots, X_n\)` are `\(n\)` **independent** random variables and `\(a_0, a_1, \dots, a_n\)` are `\(n + 1\)` constants, then consider  
`$$U = a_0 + a_1X_1 + a_2X_2 + \cdots + a_nX_n$$`
&gt; U is itself a random variable as it is a linear combination of n *independent* random variables

A particularly important use of functions of random variables concerns `\(n\)` iid random variables where each `\(a_i = \frac{1}{n}\)` for `\(i= 1, 2, \cdots, n\)`. Then we can define the random variable `\(\overline{X}\)` as follows


`$$\overline{X} = \frac{1}{n} X_1 + \cdots \frac{1}{n}X_n = \frac{1}{n}\sum\limits_{i=1}^n X_i$$`

&gt;Note that `\(\overline{X}\)` is a random variable

We can then find the mean and variance of this random variable.

###What is the point?

It does not matter if we are working with discrete or continuous random variables, as long as we have an independent and identically distributed (iid) sample of size `\(n\)` with the same mean `\(\mu\)` and the same variance `\(\sigma^2\)`, the random variable `\(\overline{X}\)` has

&gt; `\(\text{E}(\overline{X}): \mu\)`

and 

&gt; `\(\text{V}(\overline{X}): \dfrac{\sigma^2}{n}\)`

&gt;The point is that the variance of a sample mean of size `\(n\)` is the population variance devided by the sample size `\(n\)` which makes it smaller

&gt;i.e. as the sample size increases, the variability of the sample mean decreases.

### Central limit theorem

One of the most frequently used statistics in engineering applications is the sample mean. We can relate the mean and variance of the probability distribution of the sample mean to those of a single observation when an iid model is appropriate.

In the case of the sample mean, if the sample size `\((n)\)` is large enough, we can also approximate the *shape* of the *probability distribution function* of the sample mean!

### Central limit theorem
If `\(X_1, \dots, X_n\)` are **independent** and **identically** distributed (iid) random variable (with mean `\(\mu\)` and variance `\(\sigma^2\)`), then for large `\(n\)`, the variable `\(\overline{X}\)` is approximately normally distributed. That is,

$$
\overline{X} \stackrel{\cdot}{\sim} Normal\left(\mu, \frac{\sigma^2}{n}\right)
$$

This is one of the **most important** results in statistics.

A plausible model for the pair of random variables `\(W_1, W_2\)` is that they are independent, each with the marginal probability function 

`$$f(w) = \begin{cases} .1 &amp; w = 0, 1, 2, \dots, 9 \\

Comparing the two distributions, it is clear that even for a completely flat/uniform distribution of `\(W\)` and a small sample size of `\(n = 2\)`, the probability distribution of `\(\overline W\)` looks more bell-shaped than the underlying distribution.
