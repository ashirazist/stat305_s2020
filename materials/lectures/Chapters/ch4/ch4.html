### Describing Relationships between variables

This chapter provides methods that address a more involved problem of describing relationships between variables and require more computation. We start with relationships between two variables and move on to more.

## Fitting a line by least squares

**Goal:**Notice a relationship between two quantitative variables. 


&gt;We would like to use an equation to describe how a dependent (response) variable, `\(y\)`, changes in response to a change in one or more independent (experimental) variable(s), `\(x\)`.

### Line review 

Recall a linear equation of the form `$$y = mx + b$$`


Where `\(m\)` is the slope and `\(b\)` is the intercept of the line.

In statistics, we use the notation `\(y = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x + \epsilon\)` where we assume `\(\beta_0\)` and `\(\beta_1\)` are unknown parameters and `\(\epsilon\)` is some error.



The goal is to find estimates `\(b_0\)` (intercept) and `\(b_1\)` (slope) for the parameters.

### Describing Relationships

We have a standard idea of how our experiment works:

Bivariate data oftern arise because a quantitative experimental variable *x* has been varied between several different setting (treatment). 

It is helpful to have an equation relating *y* (the response) to *x* when the purposes are summarization, interpolation, limited extrapolation, and/or process optimization/ adjusment. 

*and* we know that with an valid experiment, we can say that the changes in our experimental variables actually *cause* changes in our response.

But how do we describe those response when we know that random error would make each result different...

### The Underlying Idea



We start with a valid mathematical model, for instance a line:

\\[
 y = \beta_0 + \beta_1 \cdot x
\\]

In this case, 

-  \\(\beta_0\\) is the intercept - when \\(x = 0\\), \\(y = \beta_0\\).

-  \\(\beta_1\\) is the slope - when \\(x\\) increase by one unit, \\(y\\) increases by \\(\beta_1\\) units.

## Example: Stress on Bars

An experiment examining the effects of **stress** on **time until fracture** is performed by taking a sample of 10 stainless steel rods immersed in 40% CaCl solution at 100 degrees Celsius and applying different amounts of uniaxial stress.

The results are recorded below:

|                                      |      |      |      |      |      |      |      |      |      |      |
|--------------------------------------|------|------|------|------|------|------|------|------|------|------|
| **stress** \\((\text{kg/mm}^2)\\)    |  2.5 |  5.0 | 10.0 | 15.0 | 17.5 | 20.0 | 25.0 | 30.0 | 35.0 | 40.0 |
| **lifetime** (hours)                 |  63  |  58  |  55  |  61  |  62  |  37  |  38  |  45  |  46  |  19  |

A good first place to investigate the relationship between our experimental variables (in this case, stress) and the response (in this case, lifetime) is to use a scatterplot and look to see if there might be any basic mathematical function that could describe the relationship between the variables.

-  Plotting stress along the \\(x\\)-axis and plotting lifetime along the \\(y\\)-axis we get

-  Examining the plot, we might determine that there could be a linear relationship between the two.  The red line looks like it fits the data pretty well.

### Where the line comes from

When we are trying to find a line that fits our data what we are _really_ doing is saying that there is a true physical relationship between our experimental variable \\(x\\) is related to our response \\(y\\) that has the following form:

**Theoretical Relationship**
\\[
 y = \beta_0 + \beta_1 \cdot x
\\]

However, the response we observe is also effected by random noise:

**Observed Relationship**
`\begin{align}
y &amp;= \beta_0 + \beta_1 \cdot x + \text{errors} \\\\
  &amp;= \text{signal} + \text{noise} 
\end{align}`

If we did a good job, hopefully we will have small enough errors so that we can say
\\[
y \approx \beta_0 + \beta_1 \cdot x 
\\]

]
---
.left-column[

.right-column[

### Where the line comes from

So, if things have gone well, we are attempting to estimate the value of \\(\beta_0\\) and \\(\beta_1\\) from our observed relationship

\\[
y \approx \beta_0 + \beta_1 \cdot x 
\\]

Using the following notation:
-  \\(b\_0\\) is the estimated value of \\(\beta\_0\\) and
-  \\(b\_1\\) is the estimated value of \\(\beta\_1\\)
-  \\(\hat{y}\\) is the estimated response

We can write a **fitted relationship**:
\\[
\hat{y} = b\_0 + b\_1 \cdot x 
\\]

The key here is that we are going from the underlying _true, theoretical_ relationship to an _estimated_ relationship.

In other words, we will never get the true values \\(\beta_0\\) and \\(\beta_1\\) but we can estimate them.

However, this doesn't tell us _how_ to estimate them.

### The principle of Least Squares

A good estimte should be based on the data. 

Suppose that we have observed responses \\(y\_1, y\_2, \ldots, y\_n\\) for experimental variables set at \\(x\_1, x\_2, \ldots, x\_n\\).

Then the **Principle of Least Squares** says that the best estimate of \\(\beta\_0\\) and \\(\beta\_1\\) are values that **minimize**

\\[
\sum_{i = 1}^n (y\_i - \hat{y}\_i)^2
\\]

In our case, since \\( \hat{y}\_i = b\_0 + b\_1 \cdot x\_i \\) we need to choose values for \\(b\_0\\) and \\(b\_1\\) that minimize

\\[
\sum\_{i = 1}^n (y\_i - \hat{y}\_i)^2 = \sum\_{i = 1}^n \left(y\_i - (b\_0 + b\_1 \cdot x\_i ) \right)^2
\\]
In other words, we need to minimize something with respect to two values we get to choose - we can do this by taking derivatives.

### Deriving the Least Squares Estimates(Optional reading)

We can rewrite the target we want to minimize so that the variables are less tangled together:

&lt;span style = "font-size: 60%"&gt;
`\begin{align}
\sum_{i = 1}^n (y_i - \hat{y}_i)^2 &amp;= \sum_{i = 1}^n \left(y_i - (b_0 + b_1 x_i ) \right)^2 \\\\
                                      &amp;= \sum_{i = 1}^n \left(y_i^2 - 2 y_i (b_0 + b_1 x_i ) + (b_0 + b_1 x_i )^2\right) \\\\
                                      &amp;= \sum_{i = 1}^n y_i^2 - \sum_{i = 1}^n 2 y_i (b_0 + b_1 x_i ) + \sum_{i = 1}^n (b_0 + b_1 x_i )^2 \\\\
                                      &amp;= \sum_{i = 1}^n y_i^2 - \sum_{i = 1}^n (2 y_i b_0 + 2 y_i b_1 x_i ) + \sum_{i = 1}^n \left(b_0^2 + 2 b_0 b_1 x_i + (b_1 x_i )^2 \right) \\\\
                                      &amp;= \sum_{i = 1}^n y_i^2 - \sum_{i = 1}^n 2 y_i b_0 - \sum_{i = 1}^n 2 y_i b_1 x_i + \sum_{i = 1}^n b_0^2 + \sum_{i = 1}^n 2 b_0 b_1 x_i + \sum_{i = 1}^n b_1^2 x_i^2  \\\\
                                      &amp;= \sum_{i = 1}^n y_i^2 - 2 b_0 \sum_{i = 1}^n y_i - 2 b_1 \sum_{i = 1}^n y_i x_i + n b_0^2 + 2 b_0 b_1 \sum_{i = 1}^n x_i + b_1^2 \sum_{i = 1}^n x_i^2  \\\\
\end{align}`

### Deriving the Least Squares Estimates (continued)

How do we minimize it?

-  Since we have two "variables" we need to take derivates with respect to both. 

-  Remember we have our data so we know every value of \\(x_i\\) and \\(y_i\\) and can treat those parts as constants.

**The derivative with respect to \\(\mathbf{b_0}\\)**:
`\[
-2 \sum_{i = 1}^n y_i + 2 n b_0 + 2 b_1 \sum_{i = 1}^n x_i 
\]`

**The derivative with respect to \\(\mathbf{b_1}\\)**:
`\[
-2  \sum_{i = 1}^n y_i x_i + 2 b_0 \sum_{i = 1}^n x_i + 2 b_1 \sum_{i = 1}^n x_i^2
\]`

### Deriving the Least Squares Estimates (continued)

We set both equal to 0 and solve them at the same time:

`\begin{align}
-2 \sum_{i = 1}^n y_i + 2 n b_0 + 2 b_1 \sum_{i = 1}^n x_i &amp;= 0 \\\\
-2  \sum_{i = 1}^n y_i x_i + 2 b_0 \sum_{i = 1}^n x_i + 2 b_1 \sum_{i = 1}^n x_i^2 &amp;=0 \\\\
\end{align}`

We can rewrite the first equation as:
`\begin{align}
b_0 &amp;= \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i = 1}^n y_i - b_1 \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i = 1}^n x_i  \\\\
     &amp;= \bar{y} - b_1 \bar{x}
\end{align}`

and then replace all \\(b_0\\) in the second equation (there is some algebra type stuff along the way, of course)

### Deriving the Least Squares Estimates (continued)

After a little simplification we arrive at our estimates:

**Least Squares Estimates for Linear Fit**

`\begin{align}
b_0 &amp;= \bar{y}- b_1 \bar{x} \\\\
b_1 &amp;= \frac{\sum_{i = 1}^n y_i x_i - n \bar{x} \bar{y}}{\sum_{i = 1}^n x_i^2 - n \bar{x}^2} \\\\
     &amp;= \frac{\sum_{i = 1}^n (x_i - \bar{x})(y_i - \bar{y})}{\sum_{i = 1}^n (x_i - \bar{x})^2}
\end{align}`

**Wrap Up**
&gt;-  Don't try to memorize the derivation. I will never ask you to do that on an exam.

&gt;-  Try to understand the simplification steps - the ones that moved constants out of summations for example.

&gt;-  This is one rule - there are others, but **Least Squares Estimates** have some useful properties that will make them the obvious best choice as we continue the course.

Estimating the best slope and intercept using least squares:

`\begin{align}

&lt;/span&gt;

When making predictions, don't *extrapolate*.


&gt; **Extrapolation** is when a value of `\(x\)` beyond the range of our actual observations is used to find a predicted value for `\(y\)`. We don't know the behavior of the line beyond our collected data.

&gt;**Interpolation** is when a value of `\(x\)` within the range of our observations is used to find a predicted value for `\(y\)`.

### Knowing when a relationship fits the data well&lt;/h3&gt;


So far we have been fitting lines to describe our data. A first question to ask may be something like:

-  **Q**: What kind of situations can a linear fit be used to describe the relationship between an expreimental variable and a response?

-  **A**: Any time both the experimental variable and the response variable are numeric.

**However** all fits are not created the same:

### Correlation

Visually we can assess if a fitted line does a good job of fitting the data using a scatterplot. However, it is also helpful to have methods of quantifying the quality of that fit.

&gt;**Correlation** gives the strength and direction of the linear relationship between two variables.

For a sample consisting of data pairs 
\\((x_1, y_1)\\), 
\\((x_2, y_2)\\), 
\\((x_3, y_3)\\), 
...
\\((x_n, y_n)\\), the sample linear correlation, \\(r\\), is defined by 

`\[
r = \frac{ \sum_{i = 1}^{n} (x_i - \bar{x}) (y_i - \bar{y}) }{ 
\sqrt{ \left(\sum_{i = 1}^{n} (x_i - \bar{x})^2 \right) \left(\sum_{i = 1}^{n} (y_i - \bar{y})^2 \right) } }
\]`

which can also be written as

`\[
r = \frac{ \sum_{i = 1}^{n} x_i y_i - n \bar{x}\bar{y} }{ 
\sqrt{ \left(\sum_{i = 1}^{n} x_i^2 - n\bar{x}^2 \right) \left(\sum_{i = 1}^{n} y_i^2 - n \bar{y}^2 \right) } }
\]`

**1. Sample correlation (aka, sample linear correlation)**

The value of \\(r\\) is always between -1 and +1.

-  The closer the value is to -1 or +1 the stronger the linear relationship.

-  Negative values of \\(r\\) indicate a negative relationship (as \\(x\\) increases, \\(y\\) decreases).

-  Positive values of \\(r\\) indicate a positive relationship (as \\(x\\) increases, \\(y\\) increases).

|-------------------|---------------|-----------|
| 0.9 to 1.0        | Very Strong   | Positive  |
| 0.7 to 0.9        |      Strong   | Positive  |
| 0.5 to 0.7        |      Moderate | Positive  |
| 0.3 to 0.5        |      Weak     | Positive  |
| -0.3 to 0.3       | Very Weak/No Relationship |  |
| -0.5 to -0.3      |      Weak     | Negative  |
| -0.7 to -0.5      |      Moderate | Negative  |
| -0.9 to -0.7      |      Strong   | Negative  |
| -1.0 to -0.9      | Very Strong   | Negative  |

The values of \\(r\\) from left to right are in the plot above are:
```
          r=0.9998782       r=-0.8523543    r=-0.1347395
```

-  In there first case the linear relationship is almost perfect, and we would happily refer to this as a **very strong**, **positive** relationship between \\(x\\) and \\(y\\).

-  In there second case the linear relationship is seems appropriate - we could safely call it a **strong**, **negative** linear relationship between \\(x\\) and \\(y\\).

-  In there third case the value of \\(r\\) indicates that there is **no linear relationship** between the value of \\(x\\) and the value of \\(y\\).

In each case we *can* fit a linear model. However,

-  a line is clearly a good choice for the data on the left
-  the middle data could be described well by a line, but the relationship is not as obvious as the case on the left.
-  a linear relationship is clearly clearly inappropriate for the data on the right (something like \\(x^2\\) would be better).

We need a way to identify the quality of the fit **concretely**

**1. Sample correlation (aka, sample linear correlation)**

**Example**: Stress and Lifetime of Bars

We can use it to calculate the following values:

&lt;center&gt;
&lt;span style = "font-size: 60%"&gt;
\\[
\sum\_{i = 1}^{10} x\_i = 200, 
\sum\_{i = 1}^{10} x\_i^2 = 5412.5, 
\\]

\\[
\sum\_{i = 1}^{10} y\_i = 484, 
\sum\_{i = 1}^{10} y\_i^2 = 25238, 
\sum\_{i = 1}^{10} x\_i y\_i = 8407.5, 
\\]
&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;
and we can write:
&lt;span style = "font-size: 80%"&gt;

`\begin{align}
r &amp;= \frac{ \sum_{i = 1}^{n} x_i y_i - n \bar{x}\bar{y} }{ \sqrt{ \left(\sum_{i = 1}^{n} x_i^2 - n\bar{x}^2 \right) \left(\sum_{i = 1}^{n} y_i^2 - n \bar{y}^2 \right) } } \\\\
  &amp;= \frac{ 8407.5 - 10 (20) (48.5) }{ \sqrt{ \left(5412.5 - 10 (20)^2 \right) \left(25238 - 10 (48.4)^2 \right) } } \\\\
  &amp;= -0.795
\end{align}`

&lt;/span&gt;
So we would say that stress applied and lifetime of the bar have a **strong, negative, linear relationship**.

Obviously, we would like our residuals to be small compared to the size of response values.

### Assessing models

When modeling, it's important to assess the (1) **validity** and (2) **usefulness** of your model.

To assess the validity of the model, we will look to the residuals. If the fitted equation is the good one, the residuals will be:

- Ptternless (cloud like, random scatter)
- Centered at zero
- Bell shaped distribution

To check if these three things hold, we will use two plotting methods.


&gt;A **residual plot}** is a plot of the residuals, `\(e = y - \hat{y}\)` vs. `\(x\)` (or `\(\hat{y}\)` in the case of multiple regression, Section 4.2).

#### Normality of residuals
- In addition to the residual versus predicted plot, there are other residual plots we can use to check regression assumptions. 

- A **histogram of residuals** and a **normal probability plot (QQ-plot)** of residuals can be used to evaluate whether our residuals are approximately normally distributed. 
   - However, unless the residuals are far from normal or have an obvious pattern, we generally don’t need to be overly concerned about normality.

- Note that we check the residuals for normality. We don’t need to check for normality of the raw data. Our response and predictor variables do not need to be normally distributed in order to fit a linear regression model.

#### Coeffecient of Determination (\\(R^2\\))

We know that our responses have variability - they are not always the same. We hope that the relationship between our response and our explanatory variables explains some of the variability in our responses.

\\(R^2\\) is the fraction of the total variability in the response (\\(y\\)) accounted for by the fitted relationship.


-  When \\(R^2\\) is close to 1 we have explained **almost all** of the variability in our response using the fitted relationship (i.e., the fitted relationship is good).

-  When \\(R^2\\) is close to 0 we have explained **almost none** of the variability in our response using the fitted relationship (i.e., the fitted relationship is bad).

There are a number of ways we can calculate \\(R^2\\). 
Some require you to know more than others or do more work by hand.

For an experiment with response values \\(y_1, y_2, \ldots, y_n\\)

}{
\sum_{i=1}^n (y_i - \bar{y})^2
}
\]`

-  This is the longest way to calculate \\(R^2\\) by hand.

-  It requires you to know every response value in the data (\\(y_i\\)) and every fitted value (\\(\hat{y}_i\\))

-  **Q**: What's the advantage of using the sums of squares?

Earlier, we found \\(r = -0.795\\).

Since we are describing the relationship using a line, then we can use the special case:

\\[
R^2 = (r)^2 = (-0.795)^2 = 0.633
\\]

&gt;In other words, 63.3% of the variability in the lifetime of the bars can be explained by the linear relationship between  the stress the bars were placed under and the lifetime.

- `\(R^2\)` and `\(r\)` can be drastically affected by a few unusual data points.

## Linear Relationships

- The idea of simple linear regression can be generalized to produce a powerful engineering tool: **Multiple Linear Regression** (MLR). 

- SLR is associated with **line fitting**
- MLR is associated with **curve fitting and surface fitting**

- What we mean by multiple **linear** relationship is that the relation between the variables and the response is linear **in their parameters**.

   - **Multiple linear regression in general:** when there are more than one experimental variable in the experiment 
`$$y = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x_1 + \beta_2 x_2+\cdots+ \beta_k x_k$$`
   - **polynomial equation of order k:** 
`$$y = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x + \beta_2 x^2+ + \beta_3 x^3+\cdots+ \beta_k x^k$$`

A group of researchers are studying influences on the hardness of a metal alloy. The researchers varied the percent copper and tempering temperature,
measuring the hardness on the Rockwell scale.

The goal is to describe a relationship between our response, Hardness, and our two experimental variables, the percent copper (\\(x_1\\)) and tempering temperature (\\(x_2\\)).

**Theoretical Relationship**: 

We start by writing down a theoretical relationship. With one experimental variable, we may start with a line. Extending that idea for two variables, we start with a plane:
$$
y = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x_1 + \beta_2 x_2
$$

**Observed Relationship**:

In our data, the true relationship will be shrouded in error.
`\begin{align}
y &amp;= \beta_0 + \beta_1 x_1 + \beta_2 x_2 + \text{errors} \\\\
  &amp;= [\ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \text{signal}\ \ \ \ \ \ \ ] + [\text{noise}]

This "Analysis of Variance" table has the same format across almost all textbooks, journals, software, etc. In our notation, 
- `\(SSR = 1152.1888\)`
- `\(SSE = 129.3404\)`
- `\(SSTO = 1281.5292\)`

We can use these for lots of purposes. In this class, we have seen that we can get `\(R^2\)`:

$$
R^2 = 1 - \frac{SSE}{SSTO} = 1 - \frac{129.3404}{1281.5292} = 0.8990734

The parameter estimates give us the fitted values used in our model:

Since we defined percent copper as `\(x_1\)` earlier and temperature as `\(x_2\)` then we can write:
`$$\hat{y} = 161.33646 + 32.96875 \cdot x_1 - 0.0855 \cdot x_2$$`

We can use this to get fitted values. If we use temperature of 1000 degrees and percent copper of 0.10 then we would predict a hardness of

`\begin{align}
\hat{y} &amp;= 161.33646 + 32.96875 \cdot (0.10) - 0.0855 \cdot (1000) \\\\
        &amp;= 161.33646 + 3.296875 - 85.5 \\\\
        &amp;= 79.13333

There aren't many residuals here (just 12) but we would like to make sure that the histogram has rough bell-shape (normal residuals are good). I would call this one inconclusive.

Another way to check if the residuals are approximately normal is to compare the quantiles of our residuals to the theoretical quantiles of the true normal distribution. 

From the dropdown menu, choose Normal Quantile Plot to get:

- If the points all fall on the line, then the residuals have the same spread as the normal distribution (i.e., the residuals follow a bell-shape, which is what we want). 
- If they stay within the curves, then we can say the residuals follow a rough bell shape (which is good).
- If points fall outside the curves, our model has problems (which is bad).

Consider the residual plot you would get by trying to fit a line. What would that look like?

Now consider the residual plot you would get by trying to fit a quadratic. What would that look like?

What can we do about the size of the residuals??

We need a function that can both adjust the scale our responses and account for the curve!!

One possible function that could do that: `\(ln(x)\)`.
&lt;center&gt;
&lt;img src="figure/transform-plot2.png" alt="alloy" width="300"&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;

Transforming our variables can allow us to get better fits, but you need to be careful about the meaning of the relationship. For instance, the slope now means "the change in the response when *the natural log of x is increased by 1* - the relationship to `\(x\)` itself is not always easy to translate back.

#### Dangers in Fitting Relationships
**Example**: Stress and Lifetime of Bars

&lt;img src="figure/barlife-linear-plot.png" alt="alloy" width="300"&gt;

The fitted line doesn't touch all the points, but we can push our relationship further by adding `\((stress)^2\)`, `\((stress)^3\)`, `\((stress)^4\)`, and so on. 

Everytime we add a new term to the polynomial, we give the fitted relationship the ability to make one more turn.

This leads to a problem called **overfitting**: our model is just following *the data*, including the errors, instead of uncovering *the true relationship*.

.right-column[
#### Multicollinearity

Multicollinearity can lead to several problems:
- Since the variables are all related to each other, the impact each variable has in the relationship to the response becomes difficult to determine
- Since the disentangling the relationships is difficult, the estimates of the slopes for each variable become very sensitive (different samples lead to very different estimates)
- Since the correlated experimental variables will have similar relationships to the response, most of them are not needed. Including them leads to an overfit.

Ultimately while it may look like a good fit on paper, the model will be inaccurate.

####Judging The Fit

-  Not all Theoretical Relationships we may imagine are real!

-  Perhaps a better relationship could be found using \\[ y = \beta\_0 + \beta\_1 x\_1 + \beta\_2 \ln(x\_2) \\]

-  We determine which relationships to try by examining plots of the data, fit statistics (like \\(R^2\\)), and plots of residuals.

-  Be careful of overfitting and multicollinearity (when the experimental variables are correlated).
