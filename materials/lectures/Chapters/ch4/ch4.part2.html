   &lt;h3&gt;Knowing when a relationship fits the data well&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;

So far we have been fitting lines to describe our data. A first question to ask may be something like:

-  **Q**: What kind of situations can a linear fit be used to describe the relationship between an expreimental variable and a response?

-  **A**: Any time both the experimental variable and the response variable are numeric.

**However** all fits are not created the same:

   &lt;h3&gt;Describing Fit Numerically&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;

**1. Sample correlation (aka, sample linear correlation)**

For a sample consisting of data pairs 
\\((x_1, y_1)\\), 
\\((x_2, y_2)\\), 
\\((x_3, y_3)\\), 
...
\\((x_n, y_n)\\), the sample linear correlation, \\(r\\), is defined by 

`\[
r = \frac{ \sum_{i = 1}^{n} (x_i - \bar{x}) (y_i - \bar{y}) }{ 
\sqrt{ \left(\sum_{i = 1}^{n} (x_i - \bar{x})^2 \right) \left(\sum_{i = 1}^{n} (y_i - \bar{y})^2 \right) } }
\]`

which can also be written as

`\[
r = \frac{ \sum_{i = 1}^{n} x_i y_i - n \bar{x}\bar{y} }{ 
\sqrt{ \left(\sum_{i = 1}^{n} x_i^2 - n\bar{x}^2 \right) \left(\sum_{i = 1}^{n} y_i^2 - n \bar{y}^2 \right) } }
\]`

**1. Sample correlation (aka, sample linear correlation)**

The value of \\(r\\) is always between -1 and +1.

-  The closer the value is to -1 or +1 the stronger the linear relationship.

-  Negative values of \\(r\\) indicate a negative relationship (as \\(x\\) increases, \\(y\\) decreases).

-  Positive values of \\(r\\) indicate a positive relationship (as \\(x\\) increases, \\(y\\) increases).

-  One possible rule of thumb:

| Range of \\(r\\)  | Strength      | Direction |
|-------------------|---------------|-----------|
| 0.9 to 1.0        | Very Strong   | Positive  |
| 0.7 to 0.9        |      Strong   | Positive  |
| 0.5 to 0.7        |      Moderate | Positive  |
| 0.3 to 0.5        |      Weak     | Positive  |
| -0.3 to 0.3       | Very Weak/No Relationship |  |
| -0.5 to -0.3      |      Weak     | Negative  |
| -0.7 to -0.5      |      Moderate | Negative  |
| -0.9 to -0.7      |      Strong   | Negative  |
| -1.0 to -0.9      | Very Strong   | Negative  |

   &lt;img src="line_fits.png" alt="dmc logo" height="250"&gt; 
&lt;/center&gt;

The values of \\(r\\) from left to right are in the plot above are:
```
          r=0.9998782       r=-0.8523543    r=-0.1347395
```

-  In there first case the linear relationship is almost perfect, and we would happily refer to this as a **very strong**, **positive** relationship between \\(x\\) and \\(y\\).

-  In there second case the linear relationship is seems appropriate - we could safely call it a **strong**, **negative** linear relationship between \\(x\\) and \\(y\\).

-  In there third case the value of \\(r\\) indicates that there is **no linear relationship** between the value of \\(x\\) and the value of \\(y\\).

In each case we *can* fit a linear model. However,

-  a line is clearly a good choice for the data on the left
-  the middle data could be described well by a line, but the relationship is not as obvious as the case on the left.
-  a linear relationship is clearly clearly inappropriate for the data on the right (something like \\(x^2\\) would be better).

We need a way to identify the quality of the fit **concretely**

**1. Sample correlation (aka, sample linear correlation)**

**Example**: Stress and Lifetime of Bars

We can use it to calculate the following values:

&lt;center&gt;
&lt;span style = "font-size: 60%"&gt;
\\[
\sum\_{i = 1}^{10} x\_i = 200, 
\sum\_{i = 1}^{10} x\_i^2 = 5412.5, 
\\]

\\[
\sum\_{i = 1}^{10} y\_i = 484, 
\sum\_{i = 1}^{10} y\_i^2 = 25238, 
\sum\_{i = 1}^{10} x\_i y\_i = 8407.5, 
\\]
&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;
and we can write:
&lt;span style = "font-size: 80%"&gt;

`\begin{align}
r &amp;= \frac{ \sum_{i = 1}^{n} x_i y_i - n \bar{x}\bar{y} }{ \sqrt{ \left(\sum_{i = 1}^{n} x_i^2 - n\bar{x}^2 \right) \left(\sum_{i = 1}^{n} y_i^2 - n \bar{y}^2 \right) } } \\\\
  &amp;= \frac{ 8407.5 - 10 (20) (48.5) }{ \sqrt{ \left(5412.5 - 10 (20)^2 \right) \left(25238 - 10 (48.4)^2 \right) } } \\\\
  &amp;= -0.795
\end{align}`

&lt;/span&gt;
So we would say that stress applied and lifetime of the bar have a **strong, negative, linear relationship**.

**2. Coeffecient of Determination (\\(R^2\\))**

We know that our responses have variability - they are not always the same. We hope that the relationship between our response and our explanatory variables explains some of the variability in our responses.

\\(R^2\\) is the fraction of the total variability in the response (\\(y\\)) accounted for by the fitted relationship.


-  When \\(R^2\\) is close to 1 we have explained **almost all** of the variability in our response using the fitted relationship (i.e., the fitted relationship is good).

-  When \\(R^2\\) is close to 0 we have explained **almost none** of the variability in our response using the fitted relationship (i.e., the fitted relationship is bad).

There are a number of ways we can calculate \\(R^2\\). 
Some require you to know more than others or do more work by hand.

**2. Calculating Coeffecient of Determination (\\(R^2\\))**

**Method a**. Using the data and our fitted relationship:

For an experiment with response values \\(y_1, y_2, \ldots, y_n\\) 
and fitted values \\(\hat{y}_1, \hat{y}_2, \ldots, \hat{y}_n\\) we calcuate the following:

`\[
R^2 = \frac{
\sum_{i=1}^n (y_i - \bar{y})^2 -  \sum_{i=1}^n (y_i - \hat{y}_i)^2 
}{
\sum_{i=1}^n (y_i - \bar{y})^2
}
\]`

-  This is the longest way to calculate \\(R^2\\) by hand.

-  It requires you to know every response value in the data (\\(y_i\\)) and every fitted value (\\(\hat{y}_i\\))

**Method b**. Using Sums of Squares

For an experiment with response values \\(y_1, y_2, \ldots, y_n\\) 
and fitted values \\(\hat{y}_1, \hat{y}_2, \ldots, \hat{y}_n\\) we calcuate the following:

-  Total Sum of Squares (SSTO): a baseline for the variability in our response.

\\[
SSTO  = \sum_{i=1}^n (y_i - \bar{y})^2
\\]

-  Error Sum of Squares (SSE): The variability in the data after fitting the line

\\[
SSE = \sum_{i=1}^n (y_i - \hat{y}_i)^2
\\]


-  Regression Sum of Squares (SSR): The variability in the data accounted for by the fitted relationship

\\[
SSR = SSTO - SSE
\\]

**2. Calculating Coeffecient of Determination (\\(R^2\\))**

**Method b**. Using Sums of Squares, continued

We can write the \\(R^2\\) using these sums of squares:

\\[
R^2 = \frac{SSR}{SSTO} = \frac{SSTO - SSE}{SSTO} = 1 - \frac{SSE}{SSTO}
\\]

-  **Q**: What's the advantage of using the sums of squares?

-  **A**: The values of SSTO, SSE, and SSR are used in many statistical calculations. Because of this, they are commonly reported by statistical software. For instance, fitting a model in JMP produces these as part of the output.

**Method c**. A special case when the relationship is linear

If the relationship we fit between \\(y\\) and \\(x\\) is linear, 
then we can use the sample correlation, \\(r\\) to get:

\\[
R^2 =(r)^2
\\]

**NOTE**: Please, please, please, understand that this is only true for linear relationships.

**Example: Stress on Bars **


|                                      |      |      |      |      |      |      |      |      |      |      |
|--------------------------------------|------|------|------|------|------|------|------|------|------|------|
| **stress** \\((\text{kg/mm}^2)\\)    |  2.5 |  5.0 | 10.0 | 15.0 | 17.5 | 20.0 | 25.0 | 30.0 | 35.0 | 40.0 |
| **lifetime** (hours)                 |  63  |  58  |  55  |  61  |  62  |  37  |  38  |  45  |  46  |  19  |

Earlier, we found \\(r = -0.795\\).

Since we are describing the relationship using a line, then we can use the special case:

\\[
R^2 = (r)^2 = (-0.795)^2 = 0.633
\\]

In other words, 63.3% of the variability in the lifetime of the bars can be explained by the linear relationship between  the stress the bars were placed under and the lifetime.

## Linear Relationships

- The idea of simple linear regression can be generalized to produce a powerful engineering tool: **Multiple Linear Regression** (MLR). 

- SLR is associated with **line fitting**
- MLR is associated with **curve fitting and surface fitting**

- What we mean by multiple **linear** relationship is that the relation between the variables and the response is linear **in their parameters**.

   - **Multiple linear regression in general:** when there are more than one experimental variable in the experiment 
`$$y = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x_1 + \beta_2 x_2+\cdots+ \beta_k x_k$$`
   - **polynomial equation of order k:** 
`$$y = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x + \beta_2 x^2+ + \beta_3 x^3+\cdots+ \beta_k x^k$$`

**Theoretical Relationship**: 

We start by writing down a theoretical relationship. With one experimental variable, we may start with a line. Extending that idea for two variables, we start with a plane:
$$
y = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x_1 + \beta_2 x_2
$$

**Observed Relationship**:

In our data, the true relationship will be shrouded in error.
`\begin{align}
y &amp;= \beta_0 + \beta_1 x_1 + \beta_2 x_2 + \text{errors} \\\\
  &amp;= [\ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \text{signal}\ \ \ \ \ \ \ ] + [\text{noise}]

Since we defined percent copper as `\(x_1\)` earlier and temperature as `\(x_2\)` then we can write:
$$
\hat{y} = 161.33646 + 32.96875 \cdot x_1 - 0.0855 \cdot x_2
$$

We can use this to get fitted values. If we use temperature of 1000 degrees and percent copper of 0.10 then we would predict a hardness of

`\begin{align}
\hat{y} &amp;= 161.33646 + 32.96875 \cdot (0.10) - 0.0855 \cdot (1000) \\\\

- If the points all fall on the line, then the residuals have the same spread as the normal distribution (i.e., the residuals follow a bell-shape, which is what we want). 
- If they stay within the curves, then we can say the residuals follow a rough bell shape (which is good).
- If points fall outside the curves, our model has problems (which is bad).

### Transformations: Fitting complicated relationships

Consider the residual plot you would get by trying to fit a line. What would that look like?

Now consider the residual plot you would get by trying to fit a quadratic. What would that look like?

What can we do about the size of the residuals??

We need a function that can both adjust the scale our responses and account for the curve!!

### Transformations: Fitting complicated relationships

One possible function that could do that: `\(ln(x)\)`.
&lt;center&gt;
&lt;img src="figure/transform-plot2.png" alt="alloy" width="300"&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;

Transforming our variables can allow us to get better fits, but you need to be careful about the meaning of the relationship. For instance, the slope now means "the change in the response when *the natural log of x is increased by 1* - the relationship to `\(x\)` itself is not always easy to translate back.

**Example**: Stress and Lifetime of Bars

Consider the bars example again

|                                      |      |      |      |      |      |      |      |      |      |      |
|--------------------------------------|------|------|------|------|------|------|------|------|------|------|
| **stress** \\((\text{kg/mm}^2)\\)    |  2.5 |  5.0 | 10.0 | 15.0 | 17.5 | 20.0 | 25.0 | 30.0 | 35.0 | 40.0 |
| **lifetime** (hours)                 |  63  |  58  |  55  |  61  |  62  |  37  |  38  |  45  |  46  |  19  |

**Example**: Stress and Lifetime of Bars

&lt;img src="figure/barlife-linear-plot.png" alt="alloy" width="300"&gt;

The fitted line doesn't touch all the points, but we can push our relationship further by adding `\((stress)^2\)`, `\((stress)^3\)`, `\((stress)^4\)`, and so on. 

Everytime we add a new term to the polynomial, we give the fitted relationship the ability to make one more turn.

This leads to a problem called **overfitting**: our model is just following *the data*, including the errors, instead of uncovering *the true relationship*.

**Multicollinearity**

Multicollinearity occurs when you have strongly correlated experimental variables.

### Dangers in Fitting Relationships

**Multicollinearity**

Multicollinearity can lead to several problems:
- Since the variables are all related to each other, the impact each variable has in the relationship to the response becomes difficult to determine
- Since the disentangling the relationships is difficult, the estimates of the slopes for each variable become very sensitive (different samples lead to very different estimates)
- Since the correlated experimental variables will have similar relationships to the response, most of them are not needed. Including them leads to an overfit.

Ultimately while it may look like a good fit on paper, the model will be inaccurate.

** Finding the Best Fit **

-  Again, we can use the **Least Squares** principle to find the best estimates, \\(b_0\\), \\(b_1\\), and \\(b_2\\).

-  The calculations are fairly advanced now that we have three values to estimate, 

-  so these calculations are usually done in statistical software (like JMP).

** Judging The Fit **

-  Not all Theoretical Relationships we may imagine are real!

-  Perhaps a better relationship could be found using \\[ y = \beta\_0 + \beta\_1 x\_1 + \beta\_2 \ln(x\_2) \\]

-  We determine which relationships to try by examining plots of the data, fit statistics (like \\(R^2\\)), and plots of residuals.

-  Be careful of overfitting and multicollinearity (when the experimental variables are correlated).
