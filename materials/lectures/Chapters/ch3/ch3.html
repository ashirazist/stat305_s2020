### Introduction: Creative Writing Workshops

Two methods of teaching a creative writing workshop are being studied for their effectiveness of improving writing skills.
First, two groups of creative writing students who were randomly assigned to one of two different 3-hour workshops.
At the end of the workshop, the students were given a standard creative writing test and their score on the test was recorded.

**Exam Scores for Two Groups of Students Following Different Courses**
```
              Group 1             Group 2
            74 79 77 81         65 77 78 74
            68 79 81 76         76 73 71 71
            81 80 80 78         86 81 76 89
            88 83 79 91         79 78 77 76

```
We may have several questions we are interested in answering using this data. For instance,

- Which group did better on average?
- Which group has the most consistent scores?
- Were there any unusually low or high scores in either group?
- If we ignore unusual scores, which group is better?
- Which group had the most scores over 80?
- ...

However, none of these are immediately clear looking at the raw recorded data.

### The Purpose of Summaries

Certain questions can and should be asked across many types of experiments. 

But seeing data in this kind of *flat* format presents lots of problems for a person trying to understand the relationship between the two groups.

**Summaries** are tools (mainly mathematical or graphical) which help researchers quickly understand the data they have collected. 

The purpose of a summary is to faithfully present aspects of the data in such a way that 
- we are capable of answering the types of core questions about the data asked on the previous page,
- we are able to identify more complicated aspects of the data that we may want to investigate further.

**Key Idea**: Good summaries should be quickly interpreted, provide clear insight into the data, and be widely applicable.

# Descriptive statistics

&gt;Engineering data are always variable. Given precise enough measurement, even constant process conditions produce different responses. Thus, it is not the individual data values that are important, but their **distribution**. We will discuss simple methods that describe important distributional characteristics of data.


**Descriptive statistics** is the use of plots and numerical summaries to describe data without drawing any formal conclusions.

# Descriptive statistics


Through the use of *descriptive statistics*, we seek to find the following features of data sets:


&gt;- **Center** : The point that the data are closest on average

&gt;- **Spread**: how wide the data look, how varied the points are

&gt;- **Shape **: common patterns/ trends that are present in the data

&gt;- **Outliers**: points that lie way beyond the rest of the data (wierd points)

## Graphical and tabular displays of quantitative data

Almost always, the place to start a data analysis is with appropriate graphical and tabular displays. When only a few samples are involved, a good plot can tell most of the story about data and drive an analysis.

### Dot diagrams and stem-and-leaf plots

When a study produces a small or moderate amount of **univariate quantitative data**, a *dot diagram* can be useful.

&gt;A **dot diagram** shows each observation as a dot placed at the position corresponding to its numerical value along a number line.

**Example:**[Heat treating gears, cont'd]

Recall the example from Chapter 1. A process engineer is faced with the question, "How should gears be loaded into a continuous carburizing furnace in order to minimize distortion during heat treating?" 

The engineer conducts a well-thought-out study and obtains the runout values for 38 gears laid and 39 gears hung.

            74 79 77 81         65 77 78 74

            79 75 74 73         72 76 75 79    
```

Simple graphical summaries aim to provide a better view of the entire set of data.
The best graphs are able to make important points clearly and give valuable insights with closer study.
Producing good graphs is an [art](http://www.edwardtufte.com/tufte/graphics/poster_OrigMinard.gif).

**Two common graphical summaries**

- Dot Diagrams 

- Stem and Leaf Diagrams 

  Carries much the same visual information as a dot diagram while preserving the original values exactly

### Frequency tables and histograms

Dot diagrams and stem-and-leaf plots are useful for getting to know a data set, but they are not commonly used in papers and presentations. 

&gt;A **frequency table** is made by first breaking an interval containing all the data into an appropriate number of smaller intervals of equal length. Then tally marks can be recorded to indicate the number of data points falling into each interval. Finally, frequencies, relative frequencies, and cumulative relative frequencies can be added.

## Histogram
After making a frequency table, it is common to use the organization provided by the table to create a histogram. 


A **(frequency or relative frequency) histogram** is a kind of bar chart used to portray the shape of a distribution of data points. 

Guidelines for making histograms:

- Use intervals of equal length

- Show the entire vertical axis starting at *zero*

- Avoid breaking either axes

- keep a uniform scale for axes (tick marks)

- Center bars of appropriate heights at midpoint of the intervals

## Why plotting data?

If data on the diameters of machined metal cylinders purchased from a vendor produce a histogram that is decidedly **bimodal**, this suggests

&gt;the machining was done on 2 machines or by two operators or at two different times, etc. ...

If the histogram is **truncated**, this might suggest 
&gt;the cylinders have been 100% inspected

### Scatter plots

Dot-diagrams, stem-and-leaf plots, frequency tables, and histograms are univariate tools. But engineering questions often concern multivariate data and *relationships between the quantitative variables*.


&gt;A **scatterplot** is a simple and effective way of displaying potential relationships between two quantitative variable by assigning each variable to either the `\(x\)` or `\(y\)` axis and plotting the resulting coordinate points.

Motivated by asking what is *normal/common/expected* for this data. There are three main types used: 


**Mean**: A "fair" center value. The symbol used differs depending on whether we are dealing with a sample or population:

**Quantiles**: The number that divides our data values so that the proportion, `\(p\)`, of the data values are below the number and the proportion `\(1-p\)` are above the number.


**Median**: The value dividing the data values in half (the middle of the values). The median is just the 50th quantile.

**Range**: The difference between the highest and lowest values (Range = max - min)

**IQR**: The Interquartile Range, how spread out is the middle 50% (IQR =  Q3 - Q1)

- each value in the data is an "\\(x_i\\)" (\\(i\\) is a **subscript**)

- Group 1: \\(x\_1 = 74, x\_2 = 79, ..., x\_{20} = 73\\)

- The sum: \\(x\_1 + x\_2 + x\_3 + ... + x\_{20}\\)

- divides : \\((x\_1 + x\_2 + x\_3 + ... + x\_{20})/20\\)

- Or using summation notation: \\(\frac{1}{20} \sum_{i = 1}^{20} x_i\\)

**The Quantile Function**

Two useful pieces of notation:

**floor**: `\(\lfloor x \rfloor \)` is the largest integer smaller than or equal to `\( x \)`

**ceiling**: `\(\lceil x \rceil \)` is the smallest integer larger than or equal to `\( x \)`


**Examples**

-  `\(\lfloor 55.2 \rfloor  = 55\)`

-  `\(\lceil 55.2 \rceil  = 56\)`

-  `\(\lfloor 19 \rfloor  = 19\)`

-  `\(\lceil 19 \rceil  = 19\)`

-  `\(\lceil -3.2 \rceil = -3\)`

-  `\(\lfloor -3.2 \rfloor = -4\)`

### Quantiles
Already familiar with the concept of "percentile".

The &lt;font color="red"&gt; `\(p^{th}\)` percentile&lt;/font&gt; of a data set is a number greater than `\(p\)`% of the data and less than the rest.

&gt; "You scored at the `\(90^{th}\)` percentile on the SAT" means that your score was higher than 90% of the students who took the test and lower than the other 10% 

&gt; "Zorbit was positioned at the `\(80^{th}\)` percentile of the list of fastest growing companies compiled by INC magazine.” means Zorbit was growing faster than 80% of the companies in the list and slower than the other 20%.

### Quantiles
- It is more convenient to work in terms of fractions between 0 and 1 rather than percentages between 0 and 100. We then use terminology **Quantiles** rather than percentiles. 

- For a number **p** between 0 and 1, the **p quantle** of a distribution is a number such that a fraction p of the distribution lies to the left of that value, and a fraction 1-p of the distribution lies to the right.

- if `\(p = \frac{i - .5}{n}\)` for a positive integer `\(i \le n\)`, the `\(p\)` **quantile** of the data set is 
`$$Q(p) = Q\left(\frac{i-.5}{n}\right) = x_i$$`

In both cases, the notation `\(Q(p)\)` will denote the `\(p\)` quantile.

**The Quantile Function**

For a data set consisting of `\(n\)` values that when ordered are `\(x_1 \le x_2 \le \ldots \le x_n\)` and `\( 0 \le p \le 1\)`.

We define the **quantile function** `\(Q(p)\)` as:

&lt;span style = "font-size: 50%"&gt;
`\[
      Q(p) = 
      \begin{cases}
     \small x_i &amp; \small \lfloor n \cdot p + .5 \rfloor = n \cdot p + .5 \\
      \small x_i  +\left( n p - i + .5 \right) \left( x_{i+1} - x_i \right) &amp;\small  \lfloor n \cdot p + .5 \rfloor \ne n \cdot p + .5 \\
      \end{cases}
\]` 
&lt;/span&gt;
(note: this is the definition used in the book - it's just written using *floor* and *ceiling* instead of in words)

- `\(\small Q\left(\frac{1-.5}{n}\right)\)` is called the **minimum** and `\(\small Q\left(\frac{n-.5}{n}\right)\)` is called the **maximum** of a distribution.

- `\(\small Q(.5)\)` is called the **median** of a distribution. `\(\small Q(.25)\)` and `\(\small Q(.75)\)` are called the **first (or lower) quartile** and **third (or upper) quartile** of a distribution, respectively.

- The **interquartile range (IQR)** is defined as `$$\small IQR = Q(.75) - Q(.25)$$`.

- An **outlier** is a data point that is larger than `\(\small Q(.75) + 1.5*IQR\)` or smaller than `\(\small Q(.25) - 1.5*IQR\)`.

**Example**: Find the median, first quartile, 17th quantile and 65th quantile for the following set of data values:
&lt;center&gt;
58, 76, 66, 61, 50, 77, 67, 64, 41, 61
&lt;/center&gt;

First notice that `\(n = 10\)`. It is possible helpful to set up the following table:

-  **Step 1: sort the data**

|          |    |    |    |    |    |    |    |    |    |    |
|----------|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|

&lt;/span&gt;
Finding the first **quartile** (`\(Q(.25)\)`):

-  `\( n p + .5 = 10 \cdot .25 + .5 = 3 \)`. 

-  since `\(\lfloor 3 \rfloor = 3 \)` 

   then `\(i = 3\)` and
   
   `\(Q(.25) = x_3 = 58 \)`

## Boxplots

Quantiles are useful in making *boxplots*, an alternative to dot diagrams or histograms. 

The boxplot shows less information, but many can be placed side by side on a single page for comparisons.

## Boxplots

A simple plot making use of the first, second and third quartiles (i.e., `\(Q(.25)\)`, `\(Q(.5)\)` and `\(Q(.75)\)`.

1.  A box is drawn so that it covers the range from `\(Q(.25)\)` up to `\(Q(.75)\)` with a vertical line at the median.

2.  Whiskers extend from the sides of the box to the furthest points within 1.5 IQR of the box edges

3.  Any points beyond the whiskers are plotted on their own.

**Example**: 
Draw boxplots for the groups using quantile function


```
              Group 1             Group 2
            74 79 77 81         65 77 78 74
            68 79 81 76         76 73 71 71
            81 80 80 78         86 81 76 89
            88 83 79 91         79 78 77 76
            79 75 74 73         72 76 75 79    
```

**solution**:
First we need the quartile values:

|          | `\(Q(.25)\)` | `\(Q(.5)\)` | `\(Q(.75)\)` |
|----------|--------------|-------------|--------------|
| Group 1  | 75.5 | 79 | 81 |
| Group 2  | 73.5 | 76 | 78.5 |

This means that Group 1 has IQR = 5.5 and 
   -  1.5\*IQR = 8.25

while Group 2 has IQR = 5 and 
   -  1.5\*IQR = 7.5

### Quantile-quantile (Q-Q) plots

Often times, we want to compare the shapes of two distributions.

A more sensitive way is to make a single plot based on the quantile functions for two distributions.

A **Q-Q plot** for two data sets with respective quantile functions `\(Q_1\)` and `\(Q_2\)` is a plot of ordered pairs `\((Q_1(p), Q_2(p))\)` for appropriate values of `\(p\)`. When two data sets of size `\(n\)` are involved, the values of `\(p\)` used to make the plot will be `\(\frac{i-.5}{n}\)` for `\(i = 1, \dots, n\)`.

To make a Q-Q plot for two data sets of the same size,

1. order each from the smallest observation to the largest,

2. pair off corresponding values in the two data sets

3. plot ordered pairs, with the horizontal coordinated coming from the first data set and the vertical ones from the second.

**Example:**[Q-Q plot by hand]

Make a Q-Q plot for the following small artificial data sets.

&lt;table&gt;
 &lt;thead&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;
   &lt;th style="text-align:left;"&gt; Data set 1 &lt;/th&gt;

### Quantile-Quantile Plots: 

**QQ plots** are created by plotting the values of `\(Q(p)\)` for a data set against values of `\(Q(p)\)` coming from some other source.

-  Compare the shape of two data sets (distributions).

-  Two data sets having "equal shape" is equivalent to say their quantile functions are "**linearly related**". 

-  If the two data sets have different sizes, the size of smaller set is used for both.

-  A **QQ plot** that is linear indicates the two distributions have similar shape. 

-  If there are significant departures from linearity, the character of those departures reveals the ways in which the shapes differ.

### Theoretical quantile-quantile plots

Q-Q plots are useful when comparing two finite data sets, but a Q-Q plot can also be used to compare a data set and an expected shape, or *theoretical distribution*.


&gt;A **theoretical Q-Q plot** for a data set of size `\(n\)` and a theoretical distribution, with respective quantile functions `\(Q_1\)` and `\(Q_2\)` is a plot of ordered pairs `\((Q_1(p), Q_2(p))\)` for `\(p = \frac{i-.5}{n}\)` where `\(i = 1, \dots, n\)`.


The most famous theoretical Q-Q plot occurs when quantiles for the *standard Normal* or *Gaussian* distribution are used. A simple numerical approximation to the quantile function for the Normal distribution is 

$$
Q(p) \approx 4.9(p^{.14} - (1-p)^{.14}).
$$

### Theoretical quantile-quantile plots

The standard Normal quantiles can be used to make a theoretical Q-Q plot as a way of assessing how bell-shaped a data set is. 

The resulting plot is called a **normal Q-Q plot**.

### Quantile-Quantile Plots: 
### Summary

The idea of QQ plots is most useful when applied to one quantile function that represents data and a second that represents a **theoretical distribution**

-  Empirical QQ plots: the other source are quantiles from another actual data set.

-  Theoretical QQ plots: the other source are quantiles from a theoretical set - we know the quantiles without having any data.

This allows to ask "Does the data set have a shape similar to the theoretical distribution?"

## Numerical summaries 

When we have a large amount of data, it can become important to reduce the amount of data to a few informative numerical summary values. Numerical summaries highlight important features of the data 


A **numerical summary (or statistic)** is a number or list of numbers calculated using the data (and only the data).


### Measures of location

An "average" represents the center of a quantitative data set. There are several potential technical meanings for the word "average", and they are all *measures of location*.

The **(arithmetic) mean** of a sample of quantitative data `\((x_1, \dots, x_n)\)` is 

`$$\overline{x} = \frac{1}{n} \sum\limits_{i=1}^nx_i$$`

## Numerical summaries 
### Measures of location


The **mode** of a discrete or categorical data set is the most frequently-occurring value.

We have also seen the *median*, `\(Q(.5)\)`, which is another measure of location. A shortcut to calculating `\(Q(0.5)\)` is

- `\(Q(0.5) = x_{\lceil n/2 \rceil}\)` if `\(n\)` is odd 
- `\(Q(0.5)\)` = `\((x_{n/2} + x_{n/2+1})/2\)` if `\(n\)` is even.



**Example:**[Measures of location]

Calculate the three measures of location for the following data.
`$$0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5$$`

## Numerical summaries
### Measures of spread

Quantifying variation in a data set can be as important as measuring its location. Again, there are many way to measure the spread of a data set.


The **range** of a data set consisting of ordered values `\(x_1 \le \cdots \le x_n\)` is 
`$$R = x_n - x_1.$$`


The **sample variance** of a data set consisting of values `\(x_1, \dots, x_n\)` is
`$$s^2 = \frac{1}{n-1} \sum\limits_{i=1}^n (x_i - \overline{x})^2$$`
The **sample standard deviation**, `\(s\)`, is the nonnegative square root of the sample variance.

We have also seen the *IQR*, `\(Q(.75) - Q(.25)\)`, which is another measure of spread.

## Categorical and count data

So far we have talked mainly about summarizing quantitative, or measurement, data. Sometimes, we have categorical or count data to summarize. In this case, we can revisit the *frequency table* and introduce a new type of plot.

**Example:**[Cars]

Fuel consumption and 10 aspects of automobile design and performance are available for 32 automobiles (1973–74 models) from 1974 Motor Trend US Magazine.

We can construct a frequency table for the *cylinder* variable.

&lt;table class="table" style="font-size: 12px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"&gt;
 &lt;thead&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;
   &lt;th style="text-align:right;"&gt; cyl &lt;/th&gt;
   &lt;th style="text-align:right;"&gt; Frequency &lt;/th&gt;
   &lt;th style="text-align:right;"&gt; Relative Frequency &lt;/th&gt;
   &lt;th style="text-align:right;"&gt; Cumulative Frequency &lt;/th&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
 &lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;
   &lt;td style="text-align:right;"&gt; 4 &lt;/td&gt;
   &lt;td style="text-align:right;"&gt; 11 &lt;/td&gt;
   &lt;td style="text-align:right;"&gt; 0.34375 &lt;/td&gt;
   &lt;td style="text-align:right;"&gt; 0.34375 &lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;
   &lt;td style="text-align:right;"&gt; 6 &lt;/td&gt;
   &lt;td style="text-align:right;"&gt; 7 &lt;/td&gt;
   &lt;td style="text-align:right;"&gt; 0.21875 &lt;/td&gt;
   &lt;td style="text-align:right;"&gt; 0.56250 &lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;
   &lt;td style="text-align:right;"&gt; 8 &lt;/td&gt;
   &lt;td style="text-align:right;"&gt; 14 &lt;/td&gt;
   &lt;td style="text-align:right;"&gt; 0.43750 &lt;/td&gt;
   &lt;td style="text-align:right;"&gt; 1.00000 &lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;


From this frequency data, we can summarize the categorical data graphically.

**Example**: Taking a sample of size 5 from a population we record the following values:



&lt;center&gt;
68, 54, 60, 66, 58
&lt;/center&gt;

Find the variance and standard deviation of this sample.

## Example: Finding the Variance

Since we are told it is a sample, we need to use **sample variance**.
The mean of 68, 54, 60, 66, 58 is 61.2


&lt;span style = "font-size: 60%"&gt;

`\begin{align}
\small s^2 &amp;= \frac{1}{n-1}\sum_{i=1}^5 (x_i - \bar{x})^2 \\\\
    &amp;=\small \frac{1}{n-1}\left( (x_1 - \bar{x})^2 + (x_2 - \bar{x})^2 + (x_3 - \bar{x})^2 + (x_4 - \bar{x})^2 + (x_5 - \bar{x})^2 \right) \\\\
    &amp;=\small \frac{1}{5-1} \left((68 - 61.2)^2 + (54 - 61.2)^2 + (60 - 61.2)^2 + (66 - 61.2)^2 + (58 - 61.2)^2 \right) \\\\
    &amp;=\small \frac{1}{4} \left( (6.8)^2 + (-7.2)^2 + (-1.2)^2 + (4.8)^2 + (-3.2)^2 \right) \\\\
    &amp;=\small \frac{1}{4} \left( 46.24 + 51.84 + 1.44 + 23.04 + 10.24 \right) \\\\
    &amp;= \small 33.2\\\\
\end{align}`

## Example: Finding the Standard Deviation

With `\(s^2\)` known, finding `\(s\)` is simple:

&lt;span style = "font-size: 65%"&gt;

`\begin{align}
   s &amp;= \sqrt{s^2} \\\\
     &amp;= \sqrt{33.2} \\\\
     &amp;= 5.7619441\\\\
\end{align}`
