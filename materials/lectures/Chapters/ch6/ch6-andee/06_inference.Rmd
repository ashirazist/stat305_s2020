# Introduction to formal statistical inference

Formal statistical inference uses probability theory to quantify the reliability of data-based conclusions. We want information on a population. We can use:

\vspace{.75in}

1. Point estimates:

\vspace{1.5in}

2. Interval estimates:

\vspace{1.5in}

## Large-sample confidence intervals for a mean

Many important engineering applications of statistics fit the following mold. Values for parameters of a data-generating process are unknown. Based on data, the goal is

\newpage

\begin{df}
A \emph{confidence interval} for a parameter (or function of one or more parameters) is a data-based interval of numbers thought likely to contain the parameter (or function of one or more parameters) possessing a stated probability-based confidence or reliability.
\end{df}

A confidence interval is a realization of a **random interval**, an interval on the real line with a random variable at one or both of the endpoints.

\vspace{.2in}

\begin{ex}[Instrumental drift]
Let $Z$ be a measure of instrumental drift of a random voltmeter that comes out of a certain factory. Say $Z\sim N(0,1)$. Define a random interval:
$$
(Z-2,Z+ 2)
$$
What is the probability that $-1$ is inside the interval? 
\end{ex}

\newpage

\begin{ex}[More practice]
Calculate:

\begin{enumerate}
\item $P(2 \text{ in } (X-1,X+ 1))$, $X\sim N(2,4)$
\vfill
\item $P(6.6 \text{ in } (X-2,X+ 1))$, $X\sim N(7,2)$
\vfill
\end{enumerate}
\end{ex}

\newpage

\begin{ex}[Abstract random intervals]
Let's say $X_1,X_2,\dots,X_n$ are iid with $n\ge 25$, mean $\mu$, variance $\sigma^2$. We can find a random interval that provides a lower bound for $\mu$ with $1 - \alpha$ probability:

\newpage


Calculate:
\begin{enumerate}
\item $P(\mu \in (-\infty, \overline{X} + z_{1-\alpha}\frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}})), X \sim N(\mu,\sigma^2)$
\vfill
\item $P(\mu \in (\overline{X} - z_{1-\alpha/2}\frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}}, \overline{X} + z_{1-\alpha/2}\frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}})), X \sim N(\mu,\sigma^2)$
\vfill
\end{enumerate}
\end{ex}

\newpage


### A Large-$n$ confidence interval for $\mu$ involving $\sigma$

A **$1-\alpha$ confidence interval** for an unknown parameter is the realization of a random interval that contains that parameter with probability $1-\alpha$.

\vspace{.5in}

For random variables $X_1,X_2,\dots,X_n$ iid with E($X_1) = \mu$, Var($X_1) = \sigma^2$, a $1-\alpha$ confidence interval for $\mu$ is
$$
(\overline{x} - z_{1-\alpha/2}\frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}}, \overline{x} + z_{1-\alpha/2}\frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}})
$$
which is a **realization** from the random interval
$$
(\overline{X} - z_{1-\alpha/2}\frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}}, \overline{X} + z_{1-\alpha/2}\frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}}).
$$

\vspace{.2in}

\begin{itemize}
\itemsep 1in 
\item Two-sided $1-\alpha$ confidence interval for $\mu$
\item One-sided $1-\alpha$ confidence interval for $\mu$ with a upper confidence bound
\item One-sided $1-\alpha$ confidence interval for $\mu$ with a lower confidence bound
\end{itemize}

\begin{ex}[Fill weight of jars]
Suppose a manufacturer fills jars of food using a stable filling process with a known standard deviation of $\sigma = 1.6$g. We take a sample of $n=47$ jars and measure the sample mean weight $\overline{x} = 138.2$g. A two-sided $90$\% confidence interval ($\alpha = 0.1$) for the true mean weight $\mu$ is:
\vfill
Interpretation:
\vspace{2in}
\newpage
What if we just want to be sure that the true mean fill weight is high enough?
\newpage
\end{ex}

\begin{ex}[Hard disk failures]
F. Willett, in the article "The Case of the Derailed Disk Drives?" (\emph{Mechanical Engineering}, 1988), discusses a study done to isolate the cause of link code A failure in a model of Winchester hard disk drive. For each disk, the investigator measured the breakaway torque (in. oz.) required to loosen the drive's interrupter flag on the stepper motor shaft. Breakaway torques for $26$ disk drives were recorded, with a sample mean of $11.5$ in. oz. Suppose you know the true standard deviation of the breakaway torques is $5.1$ in. oz. Calculate and interpret:
\begin{enumerate}
\item A two-sided $90$\% confidence interval for the true mean breakaway torque of the relevant type of Winchester drive.
\vfill
\item An analogous two-sided $95$\% confidence interval.
\vfill
\end{enumerate}

\end{ex}
\newpage
\begin{ex}[Width of a CI]
If you want to estimate the breakaway torque with a 2-sided, $95$\% confidence interval with $\pm 2.0$ in. oz. of precision, what sample size would you need?

\end{ex}

\newpage

### A generally applicable large-$n$ confidence interval for $\mu$

Although the equations for a $1-\alpha$ confidence interval is mathematically correct, it is severely limited in its usefulness because

\vspace{.5in}

If $n \ge 25$ and $\sigma$ is *unknown*, $Z = \frac{\overline{X} - \mu}{s/\sqrt{n}}$, where 
$$
s = \sqrt{\frac{1}{n-1}\sum\limits_{i = 1}^n (x_i-\overline{x})^2}.
$$
is still **approximately standard normally distributed**. So, you can replace $\sigma$ in the confidence interval formula with the sample standard deviation, $s$.

\begin{itemize}
\itemsep 1in 
\item Two-sided $1-\alpha$ confidence interval for $\mu$
\item One-sided $1-\alpha$ confidence interval for $\mu$ with a upper confidence bound
\item One-sided $1-\alpha$ confidence interval for $\mu$ with a lower confidence bound
\end{itemize}

Suppose you are a manufacturer of construction equipment. You make $0.0125$ inch wire rope and need to determine how much weight it can hold before breaking so that you can label it clearly. Here are breaking strengths, in kg, for $`r length(wire)`$ sample wires:
\end{ex}

```{r, comment=NA}
wire

The sample mean breaking strength is $`r round(mean(wire), 2)`$ kg and the sample standard deviation is $`r round(sd(wire), 2)`$ kg. Using the appropriate $95$% confidence interval, try to determine whether the breaking strengths meet the requirement of at least $85$ kg.

## Small-sample confidence intervals for a mean

The most important practical limitation on the use of the methods of the previous sections is

\vspace{.5in}

That restriction comes from the fact that without it,

\vspace{1in}

So, if one mechanically uses the large-$n$ interval formula $\overline{x} \pm z \frac{s}{\sqrt{n}}$ with a small sample,

\vspace{1in}

**If** it is sensible to model the observations as iid normal random variables, then we can arrive at inference methods for small-$n$ sample means.

### The Student $t$ distribution

\vspace{.2in}

\begin{df}
The \emph{(Student) $t$ distribution with degrees of freedom parameter $\nu$} is a continuous probability distribution with probability density
$$
f(t) = \frac{\Gamma\left(\frac{\nu + 1}{2}\right)}{\Gamma\left(\frac{\nu}{2}\right)\sqrt{\pi \nu}}\left(1 + \frac{t^2}{\nu}\right)^{-(\nu + 1)/2} \qquad \qquad \text{for all }t.
$$
\end{df}

The $t$ distribution
 
- is bell-shaped and symmetric about $0$
- has fatter tails than the normal, but approaches the shape of the normal as $\nu \rightarrow \infty$.

We use the $t$ table (Table B.4 in Vardeman and Jobe) to calculate quantiles. 

\vspace{.5in}

```{r, fig.height=4}
expand.grid(x = seq(-3, 3, length.out = 200),
            df = c(1, 2, 5, 11, 20)) %>%
  mutate(f = dt(x, df)) %>% 
  mutate(df = as.character(df)) %>%
  bind_rows(data.frame(x = seq(-3, 3, length.out = 200), df = "Standard normal") %>%
            mutate(f = dnorm(x))) %>%
  mutate(df = factor(df, levels = c("1", "2", "5", "11", "20", "Standard normal"))) %>%

  geom_line(aes(x, f, group = df, linetype = df, colour = df)) +
  xlab("t") + ylab("f(t)") +

  scale_linetype_discrete(expression(nu))

### Small-sample confidence intervals, $\sigma$ unknown

**If** we can assume that $X_1,\dots,X_n$ are iid with mean $\mu$ and variance $\sigma^2$, and are also normally distributed,

\vspace{2in}

We can then use $t_{n-1,1-\alpha/2}$ instead of $z_{1-\alpha/2}$ in the confidence intervals.

\vspace{2in}

\begin{itemize}
\itemsep 1in 
\item Two-sided $1-\alpha$ confidence interval for $\mu$

\end{itemize}

\begin{ex}[Concrete beams]
10 concrete beams were each measured for flexural strength (MPa). Assuming the flexural strengths are iid normal, calculate and interpret a two-sided $99$\% CI for the flexural strength of the beams. 

```{r, comment = NA, results='asis'}
beams <- c(8.2, 8.7, 7.8, 9.7, 7.4, 7.8, 7.7, 11.6, 11.3, 11.8)
print(beams)
```

\vfill

Is the true mean flexural strength below the minimum requirement of 11 MPa?  Find out with the appropriate 95\% CI.

\newpage


\begin{ex}[Paint thickness]
Consider the following sample of observations on coating thickness for low-viscosity paint.
\end{ex}

```{r, comment=NA}
paint <- c(0.83, 0.88, 0.88, 1.04, 1.09, 1.12, 1.29, 1.31, 1.48, 1.49, 1.59, 1.62, 1.65, 1.71, 1.76, 1.83)
paint
```

A normal QQ plot shows that they are close enough to normally distributed.

```{r}
y <- quantile(paint[!is.na(paint)], c(0.25, 0.75))
x <- qnorm(c(0.25, 0.75))
slope <- diff(y)/diff(x)
int <- y[1L] - slope * x[1L]

d <- data.frame(resids = paint)

ggplot(d, aes(sample = resids)) + 
  stat_qq() + 
  geom_abline(slope = slope, intercept = int)


```

Calculate and interpret a two-sided $90$% confidence interval for the true mean thickness.

## Hypothesis testing

Last section illustrated how probability can enable confidence interval estimation. We can also use probability as a means to use data to quantitatively assess the plausibility of a trial value of a parameter.

\vspace{.2in}

**Statistical inference** is using data from the sample to draw conclusions about the population.

1. Interval estimation (confidence intervals)

\vspace{.5in}

2. Hypothesis testing

\vspace{.5in}

\begin{df}
Statistical \emph{significance testing} is the use of data in th quantitative assessment of the plausibility of some trial value for a parameter (or function of one or more parameters).
\end{df}

\vspace{.2in}

Significance (or hypothesis) testing begins with the specification of a trial value (or **hypothesis**).

\vspace{.2in}

\begin{df}
A \emph{null hypothesis} is a statement of the form
$$
\text{Parameter}=\#
$$
or
$$
\text{Function of parameters}=\#
$$
for some $\#$ that forms the basis of investigation in a significance test. A null hypothesis is usually formed to embody a status quo/"pre-data" view of the parameter. It is denoted $\text{H}_0$.
\end{df}
\newpage

\begin{df}
An \emph{alternative hypothesis} is a statement that stands in opposition to the null hypothesis. It specifies what forms of departure from the null hypothesis are of concern. An alternative hypothesis is denoted as $\text{H}_a$. It is of the form 
$$
\text{Parameter}\not=\# \quad \text{ or } \quad \text{Parameter}>\# \quad \text{ or } \quad \text{Parameter}<\# \quad 
$$
\end{df}

\vspace{.1in}

Examples (testing the true mean value):
\begin{eqnarray*}
\text{H}_0: \mu = \# & \text{H}_0: \mu = \# & \text{H}_0: \mu = \# \\
\text{H}_a: \mu \not= \# & \text{H}_a: \mu > \# & \text{H}_a: \mu < \#
\end{eqnarray*}

Often, the alternative hypothesis is based on an investigator's suspicions and/or hopes about th true state of affairs.

\vspace{.2in}

The **goal** is to use the data to debunk the null hypothesis in favor of the alternative.

1. Assume $\text{H}_0$.
2. Try to show that, under $\text{H}_0$, the data are preposterous.
3. If the data are preposterous, reject $\text{H}_0$ and conclude $\text{H}_a$.

The outcomes of a hypothesis test consists of:

\newpage

\begin{ex}[Fair coin]
Suppose we toss a coin $n=25$ times, and the results are denoted by $X_1,X_2,\dots,X_{25}$. We use $1$ to denote the result of a head and $0$ to denote the results of a tail. Then $X_1 \sim Binomial(1,\rho)$ where $\rho$ denotes the chance of getting heads, so $\text{E}(X_1) = \rho, \text{Var}(X_1) = \rho(1-\rho)$. Given  the result is you got all heads, do you think the coin is fair?
\end{ex}

\vfill

In the real life, we may have data from many different kinds of distributions! Thus we need a universal framework to deal with these kinds of problems.

\vfill

\newpage

### Significance tests for a mean

\begin{df}
A \emph{test statistic} is the particular form of numerical data summarization used in a significance test.
\end{df}

\vspace{.2in}

\begin{df}
A \emph{reference (or null) distribution} for a test statistic is the probability distribution describing the test statistic, provided the null hypothesis is in fact true.
\end{df}

\vspace{.2in}

\begin{df}
The \emph{observed level of significance or $p$-value} in a significance test is the probability that the reference distribution assigns to the set of possible values of the test statistic that are at least as extreme as the one actually observed.
\end{df}

\newpage


Based on our results from Section 6.2 of the notes, we can develop hypothesis tests for the true mean value of a distribution in various situations, given an iid sample $X_1, \dots, X_n$ where $\text{H}_0: \mu = \mu_0$.

Let $K$ be the value of the test statistic, $Z\sim N(0,1)$, and $T\sim t_{n - 1}$. Here is a table of $p$-values that you should use for each set of conditions and choice of $\text{H}_a$.

\begin{table}[H]
\centering
\begin{tabular}{l | c | c c c} 
Situation & K & $\text{H}_a:\mu \not=\mu_0$ & $\text{H}_a:\mu < \mu_0$ & $\text{H}_a:\mu > \mu_0$ \\
\hline
$n \ge 25, \sigma \text{ known}$ & $\frac{\overline{x} - \mu_0}{\sigma/\sqrt{n}}$ & $P(|Z| > K)$ & $P(Z < K)$ & $P(Z > K)$ \\
$n \ge 25, \sigma \text{ unknown}$ & $\frac{\overline{x} - \mu_0}{s/\sqrt{n}}$ & $P(|Z| > K)$ & $P(Z < K)$ & $P(Z > K)$ \\
$n < 25, \sigma \text{ unknown}$ & $\frac{\overline{x} - \mu_0}{s/\sqrt{n}}$ & $P(|T| > K)$ & $P(T < K)$ & $P(T > K)$
\end{tabular}

\begin{ex}[Cylinders]
The strengths of $40$ steel cylinders were measured in MPa. The sample mean strength is $1.2$ MPa with a sample standard deviation of $0.5$ MPa. At significance level $\alpha = 0.01$, conduct a hypothesis test to determine if the cylinders meet the strength requirement of 0.8 MPa.
\end{ex}

\newpage

\begin{ex}[Concrete beams]
10 concrete beams were each measured for flexural strength (MPa). The data is as follows.

```{r, comment = NA, results='asis'}
beams <- c(8.2, 8.7, 7.8, 9.7, 7.4, 7.8, 7.7, 11.6, 11.3, 11.8)
print(beams)
```

The sample mean was $`r mean(beams)`$ MPa and the sample variance was $`r round(var(beams), 4)`$ MPa. Conduct a hypothesis test to find out if the flexural strength is different from $9.0$ MPa.



\end{ex}

\newpage


### Hypothesis testing using the CI

We can also use the $1-\alpha$ confidence interval to perform hypothesis tests (instead of $p$-values). The confidence interval will contain $\mu_0$ when there is little to no evidence against $\text{H}_0$ and will not contain $\mu_0$ when there is strong evidence against $\text{H}_0$.

The sample mean was $`r mean(beams)`$ MPa and the sample variance was $`r round(var(beams), 4)`$ MPa. At $\alpha= 0.01$, test the hypothesis that the true mean flexural strength is $10$ MPa using a confidence interval.

Twelve cars were equipped with radial tires and driven over a test course. Then the same twelve cars (with the same drivers) were equipped with regular belted tires and driven over the same course.

#### Large samples ($n_1 \ge 25, n_2 \ge 25$)

The difference in sample means $\overline{x}_1 - \overline{x}_2$ is a natural statistic to use in comparing $\mu_1$ and $\mu_2$. 

If $\sigma_1$ and $\sigma_2$ are **known**, then Proposition 5.1 tells us

\vspace{.2in}

$\text{E}(\overline{X}_1 - \overline{X}_2) =$

$\text{Var}(\overline{X}_1 - \overline{X}_2) =$

If, in addition, $n_1$ and $n_2$ are large,

So, if we want to test $\text{H}_0: \mu_1 - \mu_2 = \#$ with some alternative hypothesis, $\sigma_1$ and $\sigma_2$ are known, and $n_1 \ge 25, n_2 \ge 25$, then we use the statistic

which has a $N(0,1)$ distribution if

Using a significance level of $\alpha= 0.01$, find out if the 1/2 in bolts are more than 2 kip stronger (in shear strength) than the 3/8 in bolts. Calculate and interpret the appropriate 99\% confidence interval to support the analysis.

#### Small samples

If $n_1 < 25$ or $n_2 < 25$, then we need some **other assumptions** to hold in order to complete inference on two-sample data.

\vspace{1in}

A test statistic to test $\text{H}_0:\mu_1-\mu_2= \#$ against some alternative is 
\vspace{.5in}
$K=$
\vspace{.5in}

Also assuming 
- $\text{H}_0$ is true, 
- The sample 1 points are iid $N(\mu_1,\sigma^2_1)$, the sample 2 points are iid $N(\mu_2,\sigma^2_2)$, 
- and the sample 1 points are independent of the sample 2 points.

Then
\vspace{.5in}
$K\sim$
\vspace{.5in}

$1-\alpha$ confidence intervals (2-sided, 1-sided upper, and 1-sided lower, respectively) for $\mu_1-\mu_2$ under these assumptions are of the form:

\begin{ex}[Springs]
The data of W. Armstrong on spring lifetimes (appearing in the book by Cox and Oakes) not only concern spring longevity at a 950 N/$\text{mm}^2$ stress level but also longevity at a 900 N/$\text{mm}^2$ stress level. Let sample 1 be the 900 N/$\text{mm}^2$ stress group and sample 2 be the 950 N/$\text{mm}^2$ stress group. Let’s do a hypothesis test to see if the sample 1 springs lasted significantly longer than the sample 2 springs.
\end{ex}

```{r, fig.cap="Normal plots of spring lifetimes under two different levels of stress."}
springs <- data.frame(stress_level = c(rep(950, 10), rep(900, 10)),
                      lifetimes = c(225, 171, 198, 189, 189, 135, 162, 135, 117, 162, 216, 162, 153, 216, 225, 216, 306, 225, 243, 189))

springs %>%
  group_by(stress_level) %>%
  summarise(lifetimes = paste(lifetimes, collapse = ", ")) %>%
  mutate(stress_level = paste(stress_level, "N/mm2 Stress")) %>%
  spread(stress_level, lifetimes) %>%
  kable()

springs %>%
  ggplot(aes(sample=lifetimes, colour = factor(stress_level), group = factor(stress_level))) +
  stat_qq() +
  scale_color_discrete("Stress level (N/mm2)")

\begin{ex}[Stopping distance]
Suppose $\mu_1$ and $\mu_2$ are true mean stopping distances (in meters) at 50 mph for cars of a certain type equipped with two different types of breaking systems. Suppose $n_1=n_2= 6$, $\overline{x}_1= 115.7$, $\overline{x}_2= 129.3$, $s_1=5.08$, and $s_2= 5.38$. Use significance level $\alpha = 0.01$ to test $\text{H}_0: \mu_1-\mu_2 =-10$ vs. $\text{H}_A:\mu_1-\mu_2 < -10$. Construct a 2-sided 99% confidence interval for the true difference in stopping distances.

## Prediction intervals

Methods of confidence interval estimation andd hypothesis testing concern the problem of reasoning from sample information to statements about underlying *parameters* of the data generation (such as $\mu$). 

Sometimes it is useful to not make a statement about a parameter value, but create bounds on other *individual values* generated by the process.

> How can we use out data $x_1, \dots, x_n$ to create an interval likely to contain one additional (as yet unobserved) value $x_{n+1}$ from the same data generating mechanism?

\vspace{.2in}

Let $X_1, \dots, X_n$ be iid Normal random variables with

\begin{align*}
\text{E}(X_i) &= \mu \text{ for all } i = 1, \dots, n \\
\text{Var}(X_i) &= \sigma^2 \text{ for all } i = 1, \dots, n
\end{align*}

Then,

\vspace{1in}

Let $X_{n+1}$ be an additional observation from the same data generating mechanism.

\newpage

$\text{E}(\overline{X}_n - X_{n+1}) =$

$\text{Var}(\overline{X}_n - X_{n+1}) =$

So,

Generally, $\sigma$ is unknown, so replace $\sigma$ by $s$, and
