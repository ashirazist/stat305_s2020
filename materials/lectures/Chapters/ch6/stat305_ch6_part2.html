## Let's Play A Game
The semester is getting a little intense! You are a livinLet's break the tension with a friendly game. 

Here are the rules:
- I have a new deck of cards. 52 Cards, 26 with Suits that are Red, 26 with Suits that are Black
- You draw a red-suited card, you give me a dollar
- You draw a black-suited card, I give you two dollars

**Quick Questions** 

What is the expected number of dollars you will win playing this game?

Would you play this game?

### Be Careful About Your Assumptions

Pause for a minute and think about what you are assuming is true when you play this game. For instance,
- You assume I'm going to shuffle the cards fairly
- You assume there are 52 cards in the deck
- You assume the deck has 26 red-suited cards in it
- You assume the deck has **a** red-suited card in it

How can we make sure the assumptions are safe??
- Shuffling assumption: watch me shuffle, make sure I'm not doing magic tricks, etc 
- 52 Cards assumption: count the cards
- Red-suit assumption: Count the number of red cards

Whew! We can actually make sure all of our assumptions are good!

### Our Assumptions

I'm not going to show you all the cards. In other words, I refuse to show you the _population of possible outcomes_. This is justified: we are in a statistics course after all. 

So, let's start with our unverifiable assumption: Is it safe to assume that this is a fair game. Why would we make this assumption?

- You trust that I'm (basically) an honest person (*assumption of decency*)
- You trust that I'm getting paid enough that I wouldn't risk cheating students out of money (*assumption of practicality*)
- You saw the deck was new (*manufacturer trust assumption*)
- You want it to be an fair game because you would win lots of money if it was (*assumption in self-interest*)

### Our Assumptions

In statistical terminology, we wrap all these assumptions up into one assumption: our "**null hypothesis**" is that the game is not rigged - that the probability of you winning is 0.5

&gt;**Null Hypothesis** &lt;/br&gt;
&gt;The assumptions we are operate under in normal circumstances (i.e., what we believe is true). We wrap these assumptions up into a statistical/mathematical statement, but we will accept them unless we have reason to doubt them. We use the notation `\(H_0\)` to refer to the null hypothesis.

In this case, we could say that the probability of winning is `\(p\)` and that would make our null hypothesis
`$$H_0: p = 0.5$$`

### Our Assumptions

Of course our assumptions could be wrong. We call the other assumptions our "alternative hypothesis":

&gt;**Alternative Hypothesis** &lt;/br&gt;
&gt;The conditions that we do require proof to accept. We would have to change our beliefs based on evidence. We use the notation `\(H_A\)` (or sometimes, `\(H_1\)`) to refer to the alternative hypothesis.

In this case, we could say that our alternative to believing the game is "fair" is to believe the game is not fair, or that the probability of winning is not `\(0.5\)`. We write:
`$$H_A: p \ne 0.5$$`

### Testing the Game

The test of whether or not the game is worth playing can be defined in term of whether or not our assumptions are true. In other words, we are going to test whether our null hypothesis is correct:

&gt;**Hypothesis Tests** &lt;/br&gt;
A **hypothesis test** is a way of checking if the outcomes of a random experiment are _statistically unusual_ based on our assumptions. If we see really unusual results, then we have **statistically significant** evidence that allows us to **reject our null hypothesis**. If our assumptions lead to results that are not unusual, then we **fail to reject our null hypothesis**.

### Testing the Game

So how can we test the game? What if we tried a single round of the game? 
- What are the probabilities of the outcome of a single game? 
- If we draw a single card do we have enough evidence that the game is fair? 
- Do we have enough evidence that the game is rigged? 

Based on a single round of the game, both of the possibel outcomes are pretty normal - that's not good enough. 

If we draw a losing card, then we might be inclined to call the game unfair - even though a losing card is pretty common for a single round of the game

If we draw a winning card, then we might be inclined to call the game fair - even though a winning card may be common even when the game is not fair!

**We can make lots of mistakes!!**

### The Mistakes We Might Make

We could of course be wrong: For instance, we could, just by random chance, see outcomes that are unusual for the assumptions we make and reject the assumptions even if (in reality they are true). This is called a "Type I Error"

&gt;**Type I Error** &lt;/br&gt;
&gt;When the results of a hypothesis test lead us to reject the assumptions, while the assumptions are actually true, we have committed a Type I Error.

A common example of this is found in criminal court: 
- We assume that a individual accused of a crime is innocent (our assumption)
- After examinig the evidence, we conclude that it is there is no reasonable doubt the person is not innocent (in other words, we reject the assumption because it is very unlikely to be true based on our evidence).
- If the person truly is innocent, then we have committed a Type I error (rejecting assumptions that were true).

We could also make a different error: we could choose not to reject the assumptions when in reality the assumptions are wrong.

&gt;When the results of a hypothesis test lead us to fail to reject the assumptions, while the assumptions are actually false, we have committed a Type II Error.

Again, if we consider the example of criminal court: 
- We assume that a individual accused of a crime is innocent (our assumption)
- After examinig the evidence, we conclude that it is there is **not** evidence beyond a reasonable doubt the person is not innocent (in other words, the evidence is not enough to reject our assumption because it is still reasonable to doubt the accused's guilt).
- If the person truly is not innocent, then we have committed a Type II error (failing to reject assumptions that were false).

In general, we want to make sure that a Type I error is unlikely. To take the example of court again,
- We commit a Type II error: a guilty person goes free
- We commit a Type I error: an innocent person goes to jail; the guiilty person is still free

### The Mistakes We Might Make
Let's go back to my game: We assume I am an honest person (i.e., we assume that the probability of winning a single game is `\(p = 0.5\)`)&lt;br&gt;
**Type I Error: Rejecting True Assumptions**
- We gather evidence
- Looking at our evidence, we decide that the game was not fair even though it was.
- Fallout: you slander me, you disparge me, we have a fight, BOOOM.&lt;br&gt;

**Type II Error: Failing to Reject False Assumptions**
- We gather evidence
- Looking at our evidence, we decide that the game was fair even though it was not.
- Fallout: you play the game and lose some money.

Ideally, we won't make either error. However, we can only base our decision of our evidence we can gather - the truth is out of our grasp!

### Gathering Statistical Evidence

Okay, so we don't want to make either error - that means we need good evidence.

Like we talked about before, even if the game is fair one test round of the game would not be enough to make a good decision since drawing a red-suited card and drawing a black-suited card are both pretty normal for a single round of the game.

But what if we played the game 10 times in a row? After 10 rounds, do you think we would have enough evidence to make a decision about our assumption?

If we assume the null hypothesis, then we can make some assumptions about what results are likely and what results are unlikely. We describe the likelihood of the results that we actually get using a **p-value**

&gt;**p-value** &lt;/br&gt;
&gt;After gathering evidence (aka, data) we can determine the probability that we would have gotten the evidence we did if our assumptions were true. That probabiliity is called the p-value. If the p-value is really, really small that means that the assumptions we started with are pretty unlikely and we reject our assumptions. If the p-values is not small, then the evidence collected (aka, the data) is pretty normal for our assumptions and we fail to reject our assumptions.

In other words, we collect evidence and determine a way to measure the whether or not our data was unusual *if our assumptions are true*. 

If we have a very, very low chance of

then we reject the assumptions

Going along with the terminology we have introduced, if we have a small p-value then we reject our null hypothesis.

In this game, if we assume that the game is fair, we have

- two outcomes: success (winning) and failure (losing)
- a constant chance of a successful outcome `\((p = 0.5)\)`, assuming the game is fair)
- independent rounds of the game (assuming fair shuffle, which we can check)

In other words, if we test the game 10 times we can model the number of successful outcomes as binomial: For `\(X\)` = the total number of wins,

$$
P(X = x) = \dfrac{10!}{x!}{(10-x)!} (0.5)^x (1 - 0.5)^{10 - x}
$$

This gives us a way of getting our p-value

We played the game. Let's figure out whether our results were unusual or not.

Again, we assume the game is fair and have decided that the number of times we win will follow a binomial distribution with probabiliity function
$$
P(X = x) = \dfrac{10!}{x!}{(10-x)!} (0.5)^x (1 - 0.5)^{10 - x}
$$

Now we need to make a conclusion: do we accept or reject our assumptions? What do we consider unusual? Is it fair to decide after we play?

### Summary

- Sometimes we can know if something is true or not by examining the truth directly, but not always
- When we can't examine the truth, we need to test what we believe to be true
- A statistical test is a tool for testing our assumptions about what we believe
  - We state our assumed belief (generally our current beliefs, or the ethical beliefs, or the beliefs we hope are true, ...)
  - We come up with a way of collecting data that could validate or invalidate our assumption
  - We measure how likely it was that we would have gathered the data we did if our assumptions were correct
  - We reject the assumptions if our data is very unlikely we are our current beliefs

## Hypothesis testing

Last section illustrated how probability can enable confidence interval estimation. We can also use probability as a means to use data to quantitatively assess the plausibility of a trial value of a parameter.

**Statistical inference** is using data from the sample to draw conclusions about the population.

&gt;1. **Interval estimation (confidence intervals):** &lt;br&gt;
&lt;span style="color:red"&gt;Estimates&lt;/span&gt; population parameters and specifying the degree of precision of the estimate. 


&gt;2. **Hypothesis testing:** &lt;br&gt;
Testing the &lt;span style="color:red"&gt;validity&lt;/span&gt; of statements about the population that are formed in terms of parameters.

.right-column[
###Definition:&lt;br&gt;
Statistical **significance testing** is the use of data in the quantitative assessment of the plausibility of some trial value for a parameter (or function of one or more parameters).&lt;br&gt; 
Significance (or hypothesis) testing begins with the specification of a trial value (or **hypothesis**).

A **null hypothesis** is a statement of the form
`$$\text{Parameter}=\#$$`
or
`$$\text{Function of parameters}=\#$$`
for some `\(\#\)` that forms the basis of investigation in a significance test. A null hypothesis is usually formed to embody a status quo/"pre-data" view of the parameter. It is denoted `\(\text{H}_0\)`.

###Alternative
]
.right-column[
###Definition:&lt;br&gt;
An **alternative hypothesis** is a statement that stands in opposition to the null hypothesis. It specifies what forms of departure from the null hypothesis are of concern. An alternative hypothesis is denoted as `\(\text{H}_a\)`. It is of the form 
`$$\text{Parameter}\not=\# \quad$$` 
or 
`$$\quad \text{Parameter}&gt;\# \quad \text{ or } \quad \text{Parameter}&lt;\# \quad$$`

Examples (testing the true mean value):
`\begin{eqnarray*}
\text{H}_0: \mu = \# \quad &amp; \text{H}_0: \mu = \# \quad&amp;\ \text{H}_0: \mu = \# \\
\text{H}_a: \mu \not= \# \quad  &amp; \text{H}_a: \mu &gt; \# \quad &amp; \text{H}_a: \mu &lt; \#
\end{eqnarray*}`
Often, the alternative hypothesis is based on an investigator's suspicions and/or hopes about th true state of affairs.

The **goal** is to use the data to debunk the null hypothesis in favor of the alternative.

1. Assume `\(\text{H}_0\)`.&lt;br&gt;

3. If the data are preposterous, reject `\(\text{H}_0\)` and conclude `\(\text{H}_a\)`.&lt;br&gt;

###Probability of type I error

It is not possible to reduce both type I and type II erros at the same time. The approach is then to fix one of them.

We then fix the **probability of type I error** and try to minimize the probability of type II error.

&gt;We define the &lt;span style="color:red"&gt;probability of type I error&lt;/span&gt; to be `\(\alpha\)` (the significance level)

**Example:** [Fair coin]

Suppose we toss a coin `\(n=25\)` times, and the results are denoted by `\(X_1,X_2,\dots,X_{25}\)`. We use `\(1\)` to denote the result of a head and `\(0\)` to denote the results of a tail. Then `\(X_1 \sim Binomial(1,\rho)\)` where `\(\rho\)` denotes the chance of getting heads, so `\(\text{E}(X_1) = \rho, \text{Var}(X_1) = \rho(1-\rho)\)`. Given  the result is you got all heads, do you think the coin is fair?
`\begin{align}
\text{Null hypothesis}&amp;:  H_0: \text{the coin is fair or } H_0: \rho= 0.5\\
\text{Alternative hypothesis} &amp;: H_a: \rho \ne 0.5
\end{align}`

If `\(H_0\)` was correct, then `\(P(\text{results are all heads})= (1/2)^{25}&lt; 0.000001\)`

&gt;I don't think this coin is fair (reject `\(H_0\)` in favor of `\(H_a\)`)

In the real life, we may have data from many different kinds of distributions! Thus we need a universal framework to deal with these kinds of problems.

We have `\(n= 25 \ge 25\)` iid trials `\(\Rightarrow\)` By CLT we know if `\(H_0: \rho = 0.5 (= \text{E}(X))\)` then
$$\dfrac{\overline{X}- \rho}{\sqrt{\rho(1-\rho)/n}}\sim N(0,1) $$
We obsrved `\(\overline{X} = 1\)`, so 
$$\dfrac{\overline{X}- 0.5}{\sqrt{0.5(1-0.5)/25}}= \dfrac{1- 0.5}{\sqrt{0.5(1-0.5)/25}} = 5 $$
Then the probability of seeing as &lt;span style="color: red"&gt; *wierd or wierder* &lt;/span&gt; data is 
`\begin{align}
P(\text{Observing something wierd or wierder})&amp; = \\

**Example:** [Concrete beams, cont'd]

10 concrete beams were each measured for flexural strength (MPa). The data is as follows.

 [1]  8.2  8.7  7.8  9.7  7.4  7.8  7.7 11.6 11.3 11.8

The sample mean was `\(9.2\)` MPa and the sample variance was `\(3.0933\)` `\((MPa)^2\)`. At `\(\alpha= 0.01\)`, test the hypothesis that the true mean flexural strength is `\(10\)` MPa using a confidence interval.
Steps:
&gt;1- `\(H_0: \ \ \mu= 105 \ vs.\quad H_1: \ \ \mu\ne 10\)`

&gt;2- `\(\alpha= 0.01\)`

&gt; 3- This is two-sided test with `\(n=10\)` and 100 `\((1-\alpha)\)` % CI is

### Inference for matched pairs and two-sample data
An important type of application of confidence interval estimation and significance testing is when we either have *paired data* or *two-sample* data.

###Recall: Matched pairs

Paired data is bivariate responses that consists of several determinations of basically the same characteristics
&gt;**Example:** &lt;br&gt;

&gt;- Practice SAT scores *before* and *after* a preperation course

&gt;- Severity of a disease *before* and *after* a treatment

&gt;- Fuel economy of cars  *before* and *after* testing new formulations of gasoline

## Inference for matched pairs and two-sample data

One simple method of investigating the possibility of a consistent difference between paired data is to

&gt;1. Reduce the measurements on each object to a single difference between them

&gt;2. Methods of confidence interval estimation and significance testing applied to differences (using Normal or t distributions when appropriate)

**Example:**[Fuel economy]

Twelve cars were equipped with radial tires and driven over a test course. Then **the same twelve cars** (with the same drivers) were equipped with regular belted tires and driven over the same course. 

After each run, the cars gas economy (in km/l) was measured. Using significance level `\(\alpha= 0.05\)` and the method of critical values, test for a difference in fuel economy between the radial tires and belted tires. 

Construct a 95% confidence interval for &lt;span style= "color:red"&gt;true mean difference due to tire type.&lt;/span&gt; (i.e `\(\mu_d\)`)

Since we have paired data, the first thing to do is to find the differences of the paired data. ( `\(d= d_1 - d_2\)`, where `\(d_1\)` is associated with radial and `\(d_2\)` is associated with belted tires.)

Then writing down the information available:
`$$n= 12,\quad \overline{d}= 0.142,\quad s_d= 0.198$$`
 `$$\color{red}{\overline{d}= \frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^{n}d_i}, \quad \color{blue}{s^{2}_{d}= \frac{1}{n-1}\sum_{i=1}^{n}(d_{i} - \overline{d})^{2}}$$`


Then we just need to apply steps of hypothesis testing. Note that the null hypothesis here is that&lt;span style= "color:red"&gt; **there is no difference** between the gas economy recorded of the two different tires.&lt;/span&gt;(i.e `\(\mu_{d}=0\)`)

#### Large samples `\((n_1 \ge 25, n_2 \ge 25)\)`

The difference in sample means `\(\overline{x}_1 - \overline{x}_2\)` is a natural statistic to use in comparing `\(\mu_1\)` and `\(\mu_2\)`. 

i.e $$\text{E}(\overline{X}_1)= \mu_1\ \  \text{E}(\overline{X}_2)= \mu_2\ \  \text{Var}(\overline{X}_1)= \frac{\sigma_1^2}{n_1}\ \  \text{Var}(\overline{X}_2)=\frac{\sigma_2^2}{n_2} $$
If `\(\sigma_1\)` and `\(\sigma_2\)` are **known**, then we have


`\(\text{E}(\overline{X}_1 - \overline{X}_2) = \text{E}(\overline{X}_1) - \text{E}(\overline{X}_2)= \mu_1- \mu_2\)` 

&amp;nbsp;

`\(\text{Var}(\overline{X}_1 - \overline{X}_2) = \text{Var}(\overline{X}_1) +  \text{Var}(\overline{X}_2) = \frac{\sigma_1^2}{n_1}+ \frac{\sigma_2^2}{n_2}\)`

If, in addition, `\(n_1\)` and `\(n_2\)` are large,

`\(\overline{X}_1\sim N(\mu_1, \frac{\sigma_1^2}{n_1})\)` is independent of `\(\overline{X}_2\sim N(\mu_2, \frac{\sigma_2^2}{n_2})\)` (by CLT).

So that `\(\overline{X}_1 - \overline{X}_2\)` is &lt;span style="color: red"&gt; approximately Normal&lt;/span&gt; (trust me)

`$$Z= \frac{\overline{X}_1 - \overline{X}_2 - (\mu_1 - \mu_2)}{\sqrt{\frac{\sigma_1^2}{n_1} + \frac{\sigma_2^2}{n_2}}} \sim N(0 , 1)$$`

**Example:**[Anchor bolts]

An experiment carried out to study various characteristics of anchor bolts resulted in 78 observations on shear strength (kip) of 3/8-in. diameter bolts and 88 observations on strength of 1/2-in. diameter bolts. 

Let Sample 1 be the 1/2 in diameter bolts and Sample 2 be the 3/8 indiameter bolts. 

Using a significance level of `\(\alpha= 0.01\)`, find out if the 1/2 in bolts are more than 2 kip stronger (in shear strength) than the 3/8 in bolts. Calculate and interpret the appropriate 99% confidence interval to support the analysis.

If `\(n_1 &lt; 25\)` or `\(n_2 &lt; 25\)`, then we need some **other assumptions** to hold in order to complete inference on two-sample data.
&gt;We need two independent samples to be iid Normally distributed and `\(\sigma_1^2 \approx \sigma_2^2\)`


A test statistic to test `\(\text{H}_0:\mu_1-\mu_2= \#\)` against some alternative is 

`$$K =\frac{\overline{X}_1 - \overline{X}_2 - (\#)}{S_p\sqrt{ (\frac{1}{n_1} + \frac{1}{n_2}})}$$`

where `\(S_p^2\)` is called **pooled sample variance** and is defined as
$$S_p^2= \frac{(n_1- 1)S_1^2 + (n_2- 1)S_2^2}{n_1+ n_2- 2} $$

Suppose `\(\mu_1\)` and `\(\mu_2\)` are true mean stopping distances (in meters) at 50 mph for cars of a certain type equipped with two different types of breaking systems. 

Suppose `\(n_1=n_2= 6\)`, `\(\overline{x}_1= 115.7\)`, `\(\overline{x}_2= 129.3\)`, `\(s_1=5.08\)`, and `\(s_2= 5.38\)`. 

Use significance level `\(\alpha = 0.01\)` to test `\(\text{H}_0: \mu_1-\mu_2 =-10\)` vs. `\(\text{H}_A:\mu_1-\mu_2 &lt; -10\)`.

Construct a 2-sided 99% confidence interval for the true difference in stopping distances.
