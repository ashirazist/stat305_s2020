-  Use both **quantitative theories** (i.e., mathematical) and **scientific principles** (i.e., physics, chemistry, psychology(?)) as a guide

-  Obvious issue - math/science vast, no one knows everything. 

-  Additionally, engineers must work outside of "lab conditions" - there is no control over the environment, the users, the timing, ...

## But ...

- Without specific training in data collection and analysis, engineers' attemps can be haphazhard and poorly conceived!

- Valuable time and resources are wasted!


- Ambiguous conclusions are reached!

So, engineers need a good toolkit for best possible data collection and interpretation.

### Engineering Statistics can help!
### What is statistics?

Statistics is the science of collecting, presenting, analyzing, and making decisions from data. Often, as an engineer, it is necessary to **collect and interpret data** that will help in understanding how a new system or product works. 

Statistics has applications to engineering through quality control, process control, reliability, risk management, system identification, design of experiments, etc.

We can break down this study into three main tasks:

>**Summary:** Decribe, summarise and display data

>**Inference:** Draw conclusion from data

>**Interpretation:** Explain those conclusion in layman's terms (i.e. to people outside statistics)

## What Do I Mean Data?

Data is **essentially just information** we can record.

Examples are incredibly easy to come up with:

-  Students with majors and courses they enrolled in
```text
student   major         course
John      Philosophy    EASY 101
Kate      Engineering   SMRT 500
Mike      Mathematics   MATH 000
```

-  Amount I can bench over time
```text
Date     Weight
08/01    55 lbs.
08/02    56 lbs.
08/03    57 lbs.
08/04    59 lbs.
...      ...
12/21    345 lbs.
```

Really trivial to come up with examples

##Two Competing Theories

###Goal: Load gears into a continuous carburizing furnace to minimize distortion during heat treating 

-  **Theory 1**: Load the gears laid in a stack

-  **Theory 2**: Hang the gears from a bar

-  **Complications**: No two gears are exactly the same - if we test it how do we decide what was the effect of the gear and what was the effect of the loading method?

-  **Good engineer**: tried it both ways and collected the distortion measures from multiple attempts
```text
Method    Distortion measure (.0001 in.)
Hung      7, 8, 8, 10, 10, 10, 10, 11, 11, ..., 31, 36
Laid      5, 8, 8,  9,  9,  9,  9, 10, 10, ..., 19, 27

## Engineering Statistics

Collecting good data is part of what engineering statistics is concerned with, 
but of course that's only the first part.
**Recall:**
> **Engineering Statistics** is the study of how *best* to
>
> 1. Collect engineering data
> 2. summarize or describe engineering data, and
> 3. draw formal inferences and practical conclusions on the basis of engineering data
>
> all while recognizing the reality of variation

Recognizing the "reality of variation" in the distortion example led the engineer to run multiple tests.
This helped rules out the possibility that hanging gears is better: if hanging the gears were actually the right approach, it would be astronomically unlikely that it would have led to that many comparatively large distortions.

## Example 1

- If the engineer concludes that laying the gears in a stack is better in minimizing the distortion, but more expensive!
- Now, the question is if it is really worth it to use the results based on that experiment.
- How sure are we to use laying method?

Statistics can help to reach reliable conclusions.

### Types of studies
### Experimental study

When an engineer **collects data**, (s)he must decide how active to be. Should the engineer manipulate the process or let things happen and record the results?


>An **experimental study** (or, more simply, an experiment) is one in which the investigator's role is active. Process variables are manipulated, and the study environment is regulated.

### Randomized study

>In a **randomized experiment**, investigators control the assignment of treatments to experimental units using a chance mechanism (like the flip of a coin or a computer's random number generator).

**Example:**[Smoking - experimental]

To answer the question of if smoking affects lung capacity in young men, an investigator does the following. 

Finds 100 men age 20 who do not currently smoke. Randomly assigns 50 of the 100 men to the smoking treatment and the other 50 to the non-smoking treatment. Those in the smoking group smoke a pack a day for 10 years while those in the control group remain smoke free for 10 years. Measures lung capacity for each of the 100 men. Analyze, interpret, and draw conclusions from data.

An **observational study** is one in which the investigator's role is basically passive. A process or phenomenon is watched and data are recorded, but there is no intervention on the part of the person conducting the study.


**Example:**[Smoking - observational]

To answer the question of if smoking affects lung capacity in young men, an investigator does the following. 

Finds 100 men age 30 of which 50 have been smoking a pack a day for 10 years while the other 50 have been smoke free for 10 years. Measures lung capacity for each of the 100 men. Analyze, interpret, and draw conclusions from data.

Engineers encounter many types of data. It's important to have a way to distinguish all the different types of data you will see.

### Qualitative data

>**Qualitative** or **categorical** data are the values of basically nonnumerical characteristics associated with items in a sample. There can be an order to qualitative data, but aggregation and counting are required to produce meaningful numeric values from such data.

Example:
>-  male/female</br>
>- green/blue</br>
