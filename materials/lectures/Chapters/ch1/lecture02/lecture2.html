## Types of Data Structures

The most basic way to think about data is to imagine how the the raw observations could be organized once collected.

Collected data can be referred to as a **data set**. 
If the data set is simple enough, we can store it in a **data table** or **flat file**.
Traditional data tables store values relating to a single observation/unit/individual as a row of the table.
Each column in the table represents a value for some observed characterstic observed.

**Example**: Failure time of lightbulbs

A single brand and model of lightbulb is being examined for average failure time.
Five bulbs were run until they burned out and their lifetime was recorded in hours.
The first bulb lasted 521.4 hours, the second bulb lasted 501.2 hours, 
the third bulb lasted 541.8 hours,
the fourth bulb lasted 498.1 hours,
and the fifth bulb lasted 528.2 hours.

**Example**: Failure time of lightbulbs, continued

Assembling the results in a data table could look like this:

```text
Bulb Number       Failure Time (hours)
1                 521.4
2                 501.2
3                 541.8
4                 498.1
5                 528.2
```

Each bulb tested gets its own row - which row is attached to which bulb is identified by the first column.
The only feature being observed is failure time - so only one column of observations are recorded for each bulb.

Notice: 

-  Failure Time is a **quantitative continuous** variable. 
-  This is a **univariate data set**.

## Types of Data Structures

**Example**: Machine Parts
&gt; Suppose we get a shipment of 5000 machine parts and would like to verify that the shipment meets the standards the machinist agreed to.  We take out 100 parts and examine them carefully.  To verify that the parts are as strong as we anticipated, we measure the "Rockwell hardness" with a machine that is accurate to the first decimal place. We also examine each part for scratches and record it weight.  Further, we run the part in a test machine to determine if it works correctly.

In this case, we are gathering **4** values on each part. So for instance, 
the first of the 100 parts we examine could have a measured Rockwell hardness of 3.2, no scratches, a weight of 1.7562 g, and it works correctly. 
The second of the 100 parts we examine could have a measured Rockwell hardness of 3.1, no scratches, a weight of 1.7901 g, and does not work correctly.

## Factorial Studies

&gt;  **Factorial Studies** involve scenarios in which several process variables are indentified as being of interest and data are collected under different settings of these process variables.

&gt;  We call the process variables **factors** and the possible settings for a process variable its **levels**

&gt;  **Complete Factorial Studies** are factorial studies where data is collected from each possible combination of the levels of the factors (also known as **Full Factorial Studies**).

&gt;  **Partial(Fractional) Factorial Studies** are factorial studies where data is collected from some (but not all) possible combinations of the levels of the factors.

## Factorial Studies Example 

&gt; A pair of chemists, Walter and Jessie, are attempting to synthesize a chemical product and consider purity to be the most important quality.
There are three environments available to them ( RV, a basement, and a laboratory) and two precursors (Chemical compound) (pseudoephedrine/methylamine). They are both willing to try all their options in order to get the best results.

-  What parts of this synthesis are being treated as variables which can be controlled at the start of the experiment?

-  What are the possible values for each of these variables?

-  How many ways can the variables be combined?

lead cook - Walter, Jessie

## If You Can't Measure, You Can't Do Statistics

-  Success in statistical engineering studies requires the ability to measure
-  Methods of measurements are available for some physical properties (length, mass, temperature, ...) 
  -  Often, the behavior of anengineering system can be adequately characterized in terms of such properties
-  If it cannot, engineers  must carefully define what is about the system that needs observing and then create a suitable method of measurement.

-  Suspend a large container from one of the pieces of wood involved and poured water into it until the weight was sufficient to break the joint. 
-  Knowing the volume of the water poured into the container and the density of the water, they could determine the force required to break the joint.

Precision of a measurement is important, but for many purposes it alone is not adequate. 
-  **Accuracy**: or **Unbiasedness**; how close a measurement is to the true value "on average".

Accuracy is the agreement of a measuring system with some external standard. It can be changed without extensive physical change in a measurement method. So, we **calibrate** to improve accuracy.

**Example**: Height of an Object in Projectile Motion, cont.

However, this is not what we see in real life for a variety of reasons. This model assumes

1. \\(g\\) is constant as the ball falls, while \\(g\\) actually depends on the distance between the object and earth,

2. \\(g\\) is a known to infinite accuracy, while we would be using a value that is estimated,

3. Gravity is the only force acting on the object, ignoring drag force, electrical attractions, etc.

4. There are no other changes in the system (for instance, changes in air pressure)

We can fix these by writing a better relationship *or* we can accept that some things won't be known and use a **stochastic model** - a mathematical model that specifically allows for variation (or "randomness").
Understanding how these **stochastic models** work is a major focus of this course.

## What's my point
-  We cannot say there is no variation in the measurement or the relation under study is just affected by the components defined in the mathematical model. 

-  We can control some parts of the variation by planning the data collection process

-  There is always some error out of control which are stochastic (random)

-  Statistical methods help to deal with this randomness
