### Making Generalizations
When performing an experiment or gathering data in an observational study, the (main?) goal is to take the information you learn and apply it _outside_ of your experiment - i.e., to make _generalizations_. For instance, we may wish to 
- describe a relationship between two groups when we do not have the time or ability to gather information from from each member of the two groups,
- use the results of our experiment to predict the outcome of a scenario that has not yet occured,
- explain what part of a process are making the largest contribution to inconsistent results,
and so on. 

Our ability to make _valid_ generalizations heavily depends on the validity of two parts of the study's setup: our **population** and our **sample**.

### Populations
_def_: A **population** is the entire group of objects about which one wishes to gather information in a statistical study.



**Important**: A study's population should be _clearly described_ - there should be no question about which objects are in the population and which are not. If a study's population is _not clearly described_, then regardless of how well you execute the mechanics of the study, you will be left with the following conclusion:
> In conclusion, after performing this study we can safely say that our results can be applied to ???

### Getting Samples
The purpose of the sample is to be a representation of the population that can actually be studied in depth.
Thus, the goal when gathering the sample is to make sure that there is no question that the sample actually does represent the population.
A good sampling tecnique gives your study a indisputable connection between the sample and the population.

The gold standard of sampling methods is **Simple Random Sampling**. Using SRS, every possible sample of the same size has the same likelihood of being the sample used in the study.

### Getting Samples
However, real-world physical constraints may make simple random essentially impossible. In other words, there are "possible samples" from our population that are more likely to used in our study than others. The degree to which our study makes using some samples more likely than others is called **bias**.

In this case, we may have to make (or ask others to make) additional assumptions in order to minimize _the impact of the biased sampling_ and still connect the sample we have with the population we are interested in.

**Section 2.2**: Data Collection in Enumerative Studies

-  Enumerative studies: well defined population and sample taken from that population.

-  Most useful way to create the sample: **Simple Random Sampling** - any group of *n* objects has the same chance of composing the sample as any other group of *n* objects.

-  Suppose we have the alphabet (A, B, C, ..., Z) and wish to use simple random sampling to draw 3 letters. This means that the trio "F, M, Q" and the trio "A, B, C" have the same chance of being the letters that compose our sample.

-  "Random" is tough to do correctly on your own. There are a few simple tools, like *random number tables* or *pseudo random number generators*, that help us.

## Using Random Numbers to Get a Sample

-  These tables are generated randomly - each place on the table is equally likely to be filled by any one of the numbers 0 - 9.

-  The tables are created by taking advantage of some process that is physically random - radioactive decay or white noise for instance.

-  [RANDOM.org](http://www.random.org) for example uses the amount of atmospheric static to generate the numbers.

-  To use the randomly generated numbers to get a sample, simply assign a unique value to each item and take the items as they are generated.

For a simple random sample of size \(n\) from a population of size \(N\), 

   0. let \\(m\\) be the length in digits of \\(N\\) (for instance, if \\(N = 1032\\) then \\(m = 4\\)
   1. assign each item in the population a value between 1 and \\(N\\)
   2. starting on the top left, box the first \\(m\\) digits. If the value is between \\(1\\) and \\(N\\) then take the item with that value assigned to it as part of your sample. Otherwise, box the next four letters.
   3. continue until you have selected \\(n\\) items

Dimond and Dix experimented with three different woods and three different glues, investigating joint strength properties. Their primary interest was the effects of wood type and glue type on joint strength in a tension test and joint strength in a shear test. In addition, they found that the strengths were probably related to the variables drying time and pressure, so they hold these two variables constant. They also observed that variation in strengths could also have originated in properties of the particular specimens glued, such as moisture content although they haven't utilized this variable in the analysis of the data.

### Extraneous variables


**Extraneous variables** are undesirable variables that influence the relationship between the variables that an experimenter is examining. Extraneous variables that vary with the levels of the independent variable are the most dangerous type in terms of challenging the validity of experimental results. These types of extraneous variables have a special name, **confounding variables**.


There are three basic ways to handle extraneous variable:

- Treat them as controlled variables (Hard to extend results)

- Handle them as experimental variables and create a second homogeneous environment to compare levels of priamary experimental variables (blocking)

- Randomization

We described an ideal simple experiment and defined a few associated terms (2.3.1, 2.3.2) 

- **Managed variable**: variables where we choose the value
  - **Controlled variable**: a managed variable that only takes one value throughout our experiment. 
  - **Experimental variable**: a managed variable taking different values for different runs.
- **Response variable**: the output value; the variables whose values we wish to effect using our experimental variables
- **Concomitant variable**: Variables that we record but are not of interest.
- **Extraneous variable**: All other changes in our system.

- As always, there are many things that we can not control when we make measurements and collect data

- When we want to compare a new method to a old method, we need to be aware that the uncontrolled circumstances that existed when we first studied the old method do not exist anymore

- Take away: in order to *know* that difference in results are due to the difference in the method used (and not the difference in the uncontrolled circumstances) we must collect new data on both methods - this way, both methods be studied under the same uncontrolled circumstances.

### Techniques for Dealing with Extraneous Variables

Some aspects of the environment can not be controlled, even though they may effect the results we see. We call those aspects **extraneous variables**.

Though we can not *control* extraneous variables, we can plan our experiment to minimize their impact (2.3.2, 2.3.4)

**Note**: These techniques are part of how the experiment is *designed* - we decide this before any data is collected.

**Technique 1: Blocking**
- Designing the experiment with homogeneous mini-environments. 
- In this way, regardless of the random/uncontrolled events that occur in the mini-environment, we know every observation experienced the same event.
- When collecting the data, we record the identity of the block used. Since the block used will have different values depending on the observational unit, we call the block identifier a "blocking variable"

### Techniques for Dealing with Extraneous Variables

**Technique 2: Randomization, continued**

Example: A chemist performs 20 runs of a synthesis, 10 using substrate A and 10 using substrate B. It is believed that the chemist could become more adept with each run.

_Attempt 1_: No randomization on order: 
- **Plan**: the chemist performs all 10 syntheses using A and then performs all 10 syntheses using B.
- **Impact**: we have a changing extraneous variable ("adeptness") that will benefit the last runs
- **Result**: we can't tell the difference between whether our results change based adeptness or substrate choice

_Attempt 2_: Order chosen using randomization
- **Plan**: the chemist using a system to randomize the order of the 20 runs
- **Impact**: the chemist's change in adeptness will not benefit only one substrate
- **Result**: everything's ok!

### Dealing With Extraneous Variables, cont.

**Technique 3: Replication** 

- def: the process of repeating a run of the experiment more than once for each combination of experimental variables.
- results on the first run should be similar to the results on the second run if no experimental variables are changed - changes are the result of run-specific extraneous variables.
- after repeating multiple times, impact of run-specific effects average out
- neat: replication is strongly connected to the concept of reproducibility - the results I get should be similar to the results you get

### In Summary

The main point is this: an effective experiment is **designed** to account for the environmental conditions that could influence our response.
Doing this takes a lot of planning.
