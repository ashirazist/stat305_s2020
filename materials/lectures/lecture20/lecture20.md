### Modeling A System With Random Variables

Suppose that River U has two tributaries, River X and River Y with the following additional pieces of information:

- River X has a baseline volume that flows into River U (say, $V_X$)
- River Y has a baseline volume that flows into River U (say, $V_Y$)
- The volume flowing from each river could exceed the baseline
- The volume flowing from River X and River Y are not related
- If the volume flowing into River U from the two tributaries exceeds $M$, River U will overflow

Model this system and determine a formula for the probability that River U will overflow.
